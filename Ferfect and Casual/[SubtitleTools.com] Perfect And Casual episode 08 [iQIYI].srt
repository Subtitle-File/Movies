may kiss the bride.

00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,400
Do you remember what I said?

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,580
Hands!

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,660

What do you mean "real or not?"

21
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,650
The kiss!

22
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,960
It was fake.

23
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,320
Of course it was fake.

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,650
Really?

25
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,000
I think you kissed him for real.

26
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,130
I didn’t.

27
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,780
I swear. Absolutely not.

28
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,600
Nonsense!

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,440
The way you kissed

30
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,910
was clearly for real.

31
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,800
What way?

32
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,740
You just...

33
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,650
I just...

34
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,200
Like...

35
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,170
Like...

36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,780
Like this...

37
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,870
Are you two for real or not?

38
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,190
Professor Zhang,

39
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,230
let's take a group photo

40
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,320
with your family, okay?

41
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,120
Okay.

42
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:20,570
Okay, I’ll get ready for that.

43
00:02:20,899 --> 00:02:21,880
A moment please.

44
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,060
Ok.

45
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:24,459
Yun Shu,

46
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,910
Get ready. Let's take photos.

47
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,240
Coming.

48
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,460
Then I'll go there.

49
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,900
That...

50
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,250
You won't have feelings
for me again, will you?

51
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,690
Are you kidding me?

52
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,740
Our lips touched, that's all.

53
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,090
I just set an example.

54
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,070
Don't think too much.

55
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,530
What do you mean by "set an example"?

56
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,720
Come on, let's get closer.

57
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,990
Closer.

58
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,159
Okay, look over here.

59
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,550
Okay, everybody, smile.

60
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,320
One.

61
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:03,020
Two.

62
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,990
Three.

63
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,110
Okay, one more.

64
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,980
Smile naturally.

65
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,970
Look at the camera.

66
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,760

Grandpa,

73
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,740
Come on.

74
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,130
Come on. You two stand in the middle.

75
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:16,990
Come on.

76
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,580
Everybody, come here.

77
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,200
Dr Zhang,

78
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:19,560
Come on

79
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,410
I'm sorry for being late.
There was an emergency.

80
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,440
You’re a distinguished guest.

81
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,640
Dr Zhang,

82
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,090
Thanks for coming over.

83
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,280
It's very nice of you to come.

84
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,330
Congratulations! Congratulations!

85
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,170
Thanks.

86
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,890
Get closer. Look at the camera.

87
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:34,950
Come on!

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,110
Can I stand with...

89
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,570
Grandpa, I'll stand with you.

90
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,310
Just a moment, everyone.
I'll change the SD card.

91
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,100
They look so happy.

92
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,700
I don't know when I will

93
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,030
have a fabulous wedding

94
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,890
with all the blessings.

95
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,810
Just focus on your graduate school.

96
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,330
I can tell your fortune.

97
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,590
You’ll be single all the
time within a decade.

98
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,680
You dare to curse me!

99
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,040
You must be Yun Shu's sister, right?

100
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,200
Hello, grandpa.

101
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,220
Both of you are so beautiful.

102
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,550
Yun Shu said that you are not married yet.

103
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,900
Do you have a boyfriend?

104
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,770
Why don't I introduce a nice man to you?

105
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,660
How about Si Nian's good friend, Lu Yu?

106
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,230
Grandpa,

107
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,770
I'm not right for him.

108
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,600
What are you looking at?

109
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,780
Just giving a sigh.

110
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,860
Life is full of surprises.

111
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,220
Why didn’t you cherish
me at the beginning?

112
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,220
Cherish, my foot!

113
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,610
Thank you for not marrying me

114
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,520
to help me avoid a tragedy perfectly.

115
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,230
I... I was so good to you.

116
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,740
You just regret it! You...

117
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,260
What do I regret?

118
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,400
I won't listen. I won't listen.

119
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,670
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

120
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,890
Come on, come on.
Get closer, everybody. Get closer.

121
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,870
Okay, look at the camera.

122
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,840
The bride, take the groom's hand.

123
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,180
Come on, be happy!

124
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,040
Can I?

125
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,020
Okay.

126
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,010
Okay.

127
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,260
Come on. Look at the camera.

128
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,480
Is the love between the
bride and groom sweet?

129
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,620
Sweet!

130
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,680
How sweet is it?

131
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,610
Especially sweet!

132
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,480
Hold on.

133
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,990
This is a gift money for you.

134
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,820
Keep it.

135
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,530
Grandpa, I can't take this.

136
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,440
Take it. It's my wish.

137
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,470
Thank you, grandpa.

138
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,070
I need to thank you.

139
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,380
Today’s wedding celebration.

140
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,790
Perfect!

141
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,630
Especially the kiss just now,

142
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,770
that was even more perfect.

143
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,630
Academician Zhang.

144
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,409
You should get in the car.

145
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,670
It's time to go back to have a rest.

146
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,140
Okay.

147
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,250
Bye.

148
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,200
We'll see you in a few days.

149
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,540
Be careful.

150
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,510
Take care.

151
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,040
Mr Zhang,

152
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,190
This...

153
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,160
Here you are.

154
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,370
Grandpa gave this to you.

155
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,640
Just keep it.

156
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,080
I really can't take it.

157
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,430
I’ll change clothes.

158
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,050
Just wait for me.

159
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,440
Okay.

160
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,260
How about I take a shower first?

161
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,570
That’s good.

162
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,140
You... You go first.

163
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,160
[Turning off]

164
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,310
Yun Shu,

165
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:41,940
Yun Shu,

166
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,380
aren't you taking a shower?

167
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,350
I'm done bathing.

168
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,590
Then... Then I'll take a shower too.

169
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,290
Wait.

170
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,950
I'll go to your room

171
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,520
when you finish bathing.

172
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,290
My room?

173
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,650
Yeah.

174
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,270
We...

175
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,310
There’s still one thing left to do.

176
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,380
Okay.

177
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,610
Then I'll go first.

178
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,690
Is it very hot?

179
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,410
You sweat a lot.

180
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,630
I’m... I'm a little nervous.

181
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,890
Why are you nervous before we start?

182
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,500
Let's start.

183
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,770
Mr Zhang,

184
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,460
What on earth are you doing?

185
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,720
About

186
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,690
the kiss at the wedding today

187
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,220
I've thought about it for a long time.

188
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,910
I think I should reward you.

189
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,250
After all, I don't like
to owe others much.

190
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,520
Reward?

191
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,000
How are you going to reward me, Mr Zhang?

192
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,300
Just relax.

193
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,450
In this case,

194
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,930
you'll do better later.

195
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,180
It may take a little longer.

196
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,570
You lean it on your waist.

197
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,800
On... On the waist?

198
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,380
You’ll be more comfortable
when you do it later.

199
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,470
Let's start.

200
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,440
Mr Zhang,

201
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,730
Mr Zhang,

202
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,170
I'm... I'm not ready yet.

203
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,420
You’ll never be ready if you don't do it.

204
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,840
I’ve already said it just now.

205
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,900
You’ll never know if

206
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,190
you’re ready for it unless you start
to do it.

207
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,720
I carefully selected this

208
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,120
elementary exercise for you.

209
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,350
Finish it in an hour and a half.

210
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,440
So I can figure out

211
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,780
the situation of your
professional courses.

212
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,610
Then make a tutorial plan for you

213
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,360
according to your situation.

214
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,710
I believe that

215
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,010
your grades will definitely be
among the best in the next year.

216
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,990
I thought...

217
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,930
What did you think of?

218
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,120
Nothing.

219
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,010
Pretty good.

220
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,590
OK.

221
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,250
Get ready.

222
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,340
Let’s start.

223
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,840
Mr Zhang,

224
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,970
I'm tired today.

225
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,570
We are tired.

226
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,570
You still have eighty-nine minutes.

227
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,680
Come on!

228
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,160
Childish!

229
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,300
Lady, you succeeded
in catching my attention.

230
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,290
Let’s call it a day.

231
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,290
Go to bed early.

232
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,640
Thank you, Mr Zhang.

233
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,700
Good night.

234
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,360
Good night.

235
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:13,900
♫ Turning off the lights
in search of its trace ♫

236
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:20,089
♫ I walk steadily
on the path beneath my feet ♫

237
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:26,369
♫ I hear someone asking,
are you still here? ♫

238
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:32,330
♫ The kind person replies,
I've always been here ♫

239
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,850
♫ This love cuts through the crowd
in search of me ♫

240
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,980
♫ It isn't easy ♫

241
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,940
♫ I only wish to cherish it with you ♫

242
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,010
♫ Each and every moment ♫

243
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:49,840
♫ If I missed out, I will meet you again
in another lifetime ♫

244
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,890
I can't believe this is my wedding night.

245
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:56,800
♫ I recognise your eyes,
a secret that belongs to me ♫

246
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,720
I worked on the test paper all night!

247
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,710
Maybe God wants to tell me that.

248
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,400
I’ve changed from a graduate

249
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,520
to a man’s wife.

250
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,090
My life

251
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,780
has entered a new stage.

252
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,520
And maybe I’ll also face
some new life exam questions.

253
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:16,680
[Writing like crazy]

254
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,110
Mr Zhang, why don't you go first?

255
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,490
No, you first.

256
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,260
But it's not time yet.

257
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,950
And I didn't apply today.

258
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,490
There’s no need to strictly
follow the schedule in the future.

259
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,720
You go first.

260
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,090
Alright.

261
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,870
Thank you, Mr Zhang.

262
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,140
Why did he let me use
the bathroom first today?

263
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,890
Oh, that's right.

264
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,810
The ring!

265
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,860
The wedding ring!

266
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,050
I'm married to Mr Zhang.

267
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,020
I can't believe I forgot this.

268
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,410
Today's the first day after my wedding.

269
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,470
I'm married.

270
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,570
Please remember the password 2007.

271
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,290
I'm married.

272
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,020
Mr Zhang,

273
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,890
Why did you change the home password?

274
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,420
With my knowledge of your memory,

275
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,100
you shouldn't remember
these numbers wrong again.

276
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,400
Don't worry, I’ll keep it in mind.

277
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,500
It's our wedding date.

278
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,200
That's good.

279
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,320
Yun Shu,

280
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,430
Do you have any other plans today?

281
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,020
No!

282
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,110
Dress yourself up. We're going shopping.

283
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,050
Although it’s a contractual relationship,

284
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,580
Yun Shu doesn't delay

285
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,620
and becomes a love and career bumper.

286
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,700
Good!

287
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,210
What’s the matter? You're jealous.

288
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,970
I'm jealous? I'm not jealous.

289
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,050
Anyway, I'm almost there.

290
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,400
Almost there?

291
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,540
What do you mean?

292
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,650
Feng Qi and I!

293
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,010
It's basically settled.

294
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,750
Come on. Come on.

295
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,430
You two... In such a short term?

296
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,510
Of course it's true love.

297
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,780
I told him yesterday that

298
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,130
as long as he proposes to me,

299
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,230
I’d marry him.

300
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,590
Then what did he say?

301
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,870
Of course he said "okay".

302
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,760
Okay?

303
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,270
Just okay?

304
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,170
What do you mean "just okay?"

305
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,580
"Okay" means okay.
It means he agreed.

306
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,580
I'm thinking

307
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,000
if he’s planning

308
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,540
to propose to me now.

309
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,860
Not really.

310
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,850
A man who answered such a question

311
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,690
with merely "okay"...

312
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,290
No, it's not what you think.

313
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,430
Do you think everyone
is as incompetent as you?

314
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,960
Feng Qi is head over heels

315
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,510
for me.

316
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,890
See? He misses me all the time.

317
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,060
He sends messages to me all the time.

318
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,460
Do you want to hear it?

319
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,800
No, I’ll be "jealous".

320
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,860
Jealous? I’ll let you feel it really.

321
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,620
Yi Yi, I think our relationship
has developed too fast.

322
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,860
We'd better be friends.

323
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,280
Gao Zhi Yi, I told you that
you were being self-righteous

324
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,840
and being embarrassed.

325
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,260
You're overthinking.

326
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:15,390
Yi Yi.

327
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,120
Leave me alone.

328
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,080
Come on.

329
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,420
Yi Yi, don't be sad.

330
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,220
Feng Qi isn't good for you.

331
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,900
Mr Zhang,

332
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,070
What exactly do you

333
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,180
want me to do here today?

334
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,320
Although we are in a
contractual relationship,

335
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,290
you're still my wife

336
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,370
to outsiders.

337
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,400
So I hope when we go out

338
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,170
or when we visit
grandpa or our families,

339
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,240
you can present yourself

340
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,770
in a way that's more compatible with me.

341
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,200
A moment please.

342
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,790
Hello,

343
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,670
I want to ask if there's
a bookstore ahead.

344
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,750
Mr Zhang,

345
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,000
In fact, I appreciate your kindness.

346
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,580
You really don't have to
spend so much money for me.

347
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,950
It's my duty.

348
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,890
Let's go. It's just ahead.

349
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,850
Mr Zhang,

350
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,980
So you brought me here today

351
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,040
to buy books?

352
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,280
Then what do you think you want to buy?

353
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,720
Nothing. It's fine.

354
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,340
I've read the test paper
you finished yesterday.

355
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,140
You're found deficient in basic knowledge.

356
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,800
And tutoring needs to be
carried out systematically.

357
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,280
I made a book list for you.

358
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,380
Just find out all the books.

359
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,600
Statistics by editor-in-chief
Zhang Yi Hua.

360
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,570
Statistics.

361
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,080
Zhang Yi Hua.

362
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,010
I found it.

363
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,490
Applied Linear Analysis.

364
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,180
Theory of Probability
and Mathematical Statistics.

365
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,120
Statistics: From Statistics to Conclusion.

366
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,360
Found it.

367
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,830
Next.

368
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,560
Functions of Complex Variables.

369
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,210
Experimental Guidance
of Statistical Principles.

370
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,780
Management Statistics.

371
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,100
Found it.

372
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,330
Next tier.

373
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,220
From today on,

374
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,130
you should learn to read more efficiently.

375
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,010
Because this is just
your book list for a week.

376
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:46,730
One week?

377
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,370
By the way, there's another one.

378
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,140
High-order Statistics Method

379
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,530
of Independent Analysis of Components.

380
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,080
It's over there. I just saw it.

381
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,160
Where is the book, Mr Zhang?

382
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,600
I see it.

383
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,730
Thank you, Mr Zhang.

384
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,650
Are you hungry?

385
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,750
Not me.

386
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,150
There's no one else here.

387
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,100
Really not me!

388
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,720
Let's eat something.

389
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,370
Good afternoon! What
would you like to order?

390
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,020
Are you dissatisfied with the food here?

391
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,730
No! No!

392
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,810
Then you want to eat something else?

393
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,140
I... I want fried chicken.

394
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,280
Sorry, we don't offer fried chicken.

395
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,600
OK, then I'll order something else.

396
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,890
Is there any fresh chicken in the shop?

397
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,390
Yeah.

398
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,230
Do you have linseed oil or olive oil?

399
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,290
Yeah.

400
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,250
You have eggs, flour and bread crumbs

401
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,990
and all kinds of spices, right?

402
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:23,780
You have all the things I said.

403
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,460
Then there should be no
difficulty in making a fried chicken.

404
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,430
The oil temperature should
be kept at 180 degrees.

405
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,170
The error should not exceed three degrees.

406
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,950
Only then will it have a nice texture.

407
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm sorry, sir. Restaurant policy.

408
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,350
We can only cook what's on the menu.

409
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,000
Mr Zhang,

410
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,650
I remember you.

411
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,220
You’re from Zheng Ben University, right?

412
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,520
In Mr Zhang's class last time,

413
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,920
you sat in front of me.

414
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,510
Sister, you do have a good memory.

415
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,700
I major in Economics.

416
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,770
This is my senior year.

417
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,680
I often go to Mr Zhang's class secretly.

418
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,050
I'll deal with it.
You go on with other things.

419
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:54,840
Mr Zhang,

420
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,490
What would you like to eat today?

421
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,050
A seafood salad with vinegar dressing

422
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,730
and a fried chicken

423
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,760
with canola oil.

424
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:02,780
Fried chicken?

425
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,600
Who told you to add
dishes without permission?

426
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,290
The rhythm of the kitchen
is all messed up by you.

427
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,490
The dishes they requested
weren't complicated.

428
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:16,450
So I...

429
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,150
Can you do that as long as
it's not complicated to make?

430
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,060
I just...

431
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,960
Sorry, manager.

432
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,870
Please don't say that about her.

433
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,680
We made her do it.

434
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,580
So please stop blaming her.

435
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,050
Guest.

436
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,630
We have met all your requirements.

437
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,250
Please stop interfering with

438
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,760
my discipline of my employees.

439
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,900
Then you can't personally attack her.

440
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,340
Because she's useless

441
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,660
and ruins business.

442
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,300
On what background can you say that?

443
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,830
If all of your employees were like her,

444
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,330
your restaurant would be better off.

445
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,510
What makes you say that?

446
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,380
Because the other
employees in your restaurant

447
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,640
look unhappy.

448
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,530
She's the only one

449
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,970
who deals with the guests with a smile.

450
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,390
Smile can make more profits?

451
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,350
Why are you all so naive?

452
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,140
You.

453
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,330
This is really not naive.

454
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,940
I'm sure you don't know

455
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,930
the variable relationship between the
index model of customer satisfaction

456
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,350
and beverage profits.

457
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,430
The catering industry
belongs to the service industry.

458
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,210
Customer satisfaction
is the primary productivity.

459
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,950
Instead of blindly rejecting
the guest's request,

460
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,030
it's better to adapt to
meet the needs of guests.

461
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,240
I suggest you study

462
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,500
index models carefully.

463
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:23,730
If you can't understand,

464
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,150
you can ask her for advice directly.

465
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,520
And she'll give you all the answers.

466
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:26,930
Come on.

467
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,850
Besides,

468
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,670
have you noticed

469
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,020
the man by the window?

470
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,060
He's a Michelin star inspector.

471
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,550
Don't you want your restaurant

472
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,050
to be on the Michelin Restaurant Guide?

473
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:47,210
Mr Zhang, I have a question for you.

474
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,900
How did you know the
one by the window just now

475
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,890
was a Michelin star inspector?

476
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,100
I really didn't know.

477
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,780
Then you lied?

478
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,150
A white lie is not a lie.

479
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,880
That's what you said.

480
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,370
Mr Zhang, don't worry

481
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,640
I'll definitely finish reading
these books when I go back.

482
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:25,610
And

483
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,430
I certainly won't let you down.

484
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,510
I'll do my best in my senior year
to graduate.

485
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,450
What about after that?

486
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,540
Mr Zhang,

487
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:39,930
Do you also feel that

488
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,350
I'm a useless person?

489
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,260
Why do you think about yourself like that?

490
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,930
Does it matter what I think?

491
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,420
Anyway, everyone
thinks I'm fooling around.

492
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,650
At least in my opinion,

493
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,260
you aren't nothing

494
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,710
or a useless person either.

495
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,470
You just haven't found

496
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,660
your place yet.

497
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,990
Just like the theory of
"casual" you told me about.

498
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,450
You want to make
yourself at ease and happy.

499
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:10,910
This is indeed a choice

500
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,940
and a good idea.

501
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,640
But the reality

502
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,860
usually makes you feel
that it's counterproductive.

503
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,460
Oh?

504
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,430
Do not worry.

505
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,280
This year,

506
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,390
I'll try my best to help you.

507
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,980
Let's start with a degree certificate.

508
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:26,000
I believe that when the contract ends,

509
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,770
you're sure to find

510
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,320
your own life direction.

511
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,620
Let's go home.

512
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,260
Okay.

513
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,580
Yi Yi.

514
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,450
I just thought about it.

515
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,280
In fact, I think Zhang Si Nian

516
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,240
is a very nice person.

517
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,120
Think about it.

518
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:53,460
He is thoughtful, straightforward,

519
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,110
handsome, rich,

520
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,170
with high IQ and EQ,

521
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,980
and quite responsible.

522
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,540
I see.

523
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,580
You know what?

524
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,510
I know what's wrong with you.

525
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,200
What's wrong with me?

526
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,360
Yun Shu,

527
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,280
You like Zhang Si Nian.

528
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,440
Nonsense.

529
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,650
How can I like Zhang Si Nian?

530
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:24,690
Question.

531
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,310
Answer.

532
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,590
Coffee or tea?

533
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,190
Coffee.

534
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,280
Latte or American coffee?

535
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:28,930
Latte.

536
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,050
Cold or hot?

537
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:30,540
Cold.

538
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,620
Red or blue?

539
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,260
Red.

540
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:32,880
Summer or winter?

541
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:33,290
Summer.

542
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,130
Chinese or Math?

543
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:34,450
Chinese.

544
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,340
Wu Yi Fan or Zhang Si Nian?

545
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,310
Zhang Si Nian.

546
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,820
Yun Shu.

547
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,910
Mr Zhang, when did you come back?

548
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,050
It's been more than three
minutes since I came back.

549
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,140
Did you just

550
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,430
wipe your face with my clothes?

551
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,870
No, I was just checking

552
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,900
if the clothes are clean.

553
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,530
It turned out that it didn't
seem to be very clean.

554
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,139
So I'm going to wash it again.

555
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,110
Wait.

556
00:32:16,989 --> 00:32:18,639
I have something

557
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,050
to talk to you about.

558
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:22,270
I'll take a shower first.

559
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,290
Mr Zhang,

560
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,600
Yun Shu,

561
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,350
Sit over here.

562
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,670
I bought you a financial product

563
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,210
