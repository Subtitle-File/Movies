I mean that the rice

121
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,060
was on your face.

122
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,780

took you to attend his class

123
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,610

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,690
Mr Zhang must smell it.

131
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,150
It's a smell of

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,520
falling in love.

133
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,080

135
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,040
And I feel like

136
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,830
that I really fell in love with Mr Zhang.

137
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,080
Great.

138
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,810
Whatever, if you like a man,
you should take the initiative.

139
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,790
But we're contractual relationship.

140
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,900
Maybe he doesn't

141
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,970
like me.

142
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,210
Look at you, little fool.

143
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,580
Mr Zhang married you.

144
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,910
He gave you a house.

145
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,010
Also, he took you to his
class and fed you publicly.

146
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,800
He definitely loves you.

147
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,780
What more do you want?

148
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,690
Well, what if he just

149
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,010
fulfil his performance?

150
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,380
Who cares?

151
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,680
If you try,

152
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,810
the contractual relationship
can turn to be a real love.

153
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,740
What should I do then?

154
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:00,990
First,

155
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,580
you should give him a hint that

156
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,980
you're in a relationship now.

157
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,610
And then you can give
him some love signals.

158
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,380
Giving him the eye.

159
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,430
And finally,

160
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,080
you can take action.

161
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,580
Just show your feelings
to Mr Zhang directly.

162
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,380
So.

163
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,640
He'll know your mind.

164
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,010
OK, I got it.

165
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,230
You...

166
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,590
You've known that?

167
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,780
You paid attention

168
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,510
to my lecture yesterday,

169
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,430
so the accuracy of this testing paper

170
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,190
rose by 30 percent.

171
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,770
Why have you been

172
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,160
staring at me recently?

173
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,790
I... I... I haven't.

174
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,850
Do you wanna

175
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,180
ask me any questions?

176
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,090
Well, Mr Zhang, I have something for you.

177
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,760
Wait a second, I'm going to get it.

178
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,770
Pyjamas.

179
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,200
Coloured?

180
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,230
I show the wrong one.

181
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,760
It's not yours.

182
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,120
This one is yours.

183
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,830
They both look the same.

184
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,840
Because they're sweetheart outfits.

185
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,650
The sweetheart outfit of
the store are on sale today.

186
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,340
So I bought them.

187
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,130
Egyptian Cotton.

188
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,680
It feels nice

189
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,530
I'll take this gift.

190
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,560
Anyway.

191
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,580
The income of financing

192
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,650
is your cost of daily living.

193
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,610
In the future,

194
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,810
you can spend more money on yourself.

195
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,020
OK, I got it.

196
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,340
It's late today.

197
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,430
Go to the bed and have a rest.

198
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,400
Good night.

199
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,400
Good night.

200
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,460
Many shop assistants can judge

201
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,630
what kind of person the customer is.

202
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,310
So an excellent shop
assistant should be equipped

203
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,360
with this important working technique.

204
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,730
If we can digitalize our

205
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,810
intuitive judgment,

206
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,790
we can get our desired answer

207
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,360
by computing.

208
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,210
First step,

209
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,680
we can set

210
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:18,280
the prior probability

211
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,640
through our experience.

212
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,830
Mr Zhang is really handsome.

213
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,860
He doesn't only look good,

214
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,640
but also knowledgeable.

215
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,960
Really?

216
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,330
Oh, give me break.

217
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,570
Don't be his fangirls.

218
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,950
Bullshit.

219
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,780
It's useless for him to be knowledgeable.

220
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,320
He's just teaching math.

221
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,530
So what?

222
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,360
Math is the cornerstone
of human development.

223
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,110
Do you know that?

224
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,210
Cornerstone?

225
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,660
It's just a stepping-stone.

226
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,600
You know nothing.

227
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,430
Shallow people like you

228
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,310
will have a gloomy future.

229
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,270
I have a gloomy future?

230
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,300
Do you know how much money I
can earn through playing games?

231
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,490
I'm not interested in it.

232
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,760
It's time for class now.

233
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,160
If you have any question,

234
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,000
you can raise the question

235
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:10,540
so that we can have a discussion.

236
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,930
Since Mr Zhang let us to discuss it.

237
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,280
I'd like to ask you something.

238
00:15:15,369 --> 00:15:16,010
Mr Zhang,

239
00:15:16,099 --> 00:15:18,900
Those subjects we have to learn such as
mathematical analysis,

240
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,880
complex function,

241
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,609
reliability mathematics and et cetera

242
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,260
won't be useful in life

243
00:15:23,349 --> 00:15:24,930
once we graduate.

244
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,109
What's the point?

245
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,079
Can we get a job with it?

246
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,349
How much will we earn?

247
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,829
If I team with my
classmates to play games,

248
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,369
we can earn much more money.

249
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,920
It seems that you're a curious student.

250
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,280
You raised three questions just now.

251
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,560
Well, what is Math?

252
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,920
Math lays the rational
foundation for people

253
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:40,990
to know the world.

254
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,140
Though many irrational
behaviours abound

255
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,730
in the world,

256
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,360
people always hope they can

257
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,890
picture these phenomena in a rational way.

258
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,900
For example,

259
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,370
in terms of statistics,

260
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,460
we have some mental effects

261
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,480
like the Matthew Effect,

262
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,580
Break Pane Law,
Marshmallow Effect and so on.

263
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,480
Besides,

264
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,050
in anthropology,

265
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,580
there are also

266
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,630
the Crowd Theory

267
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,100
and the Wisdom of Crowds.

268
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,490
Hold on, Mr Zhang.

269
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,090
I can't understand what you said just now.

270
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,440
Can you put it plainly?

271
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,100
You play games, right?

272
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,680
Computer games?

273
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,660
Yeah.

274
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,680
In the middle of last century,

275
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,430
Turing and von Neumann

276
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,200
by virtue of their solid
mathematical knowledge,

277
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,730
created the structural pattern
of modern computer,

278
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,760
leading people

279
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,420
into the Information Age.

280
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,090
No offence.

281
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,170
If there is no math,

282
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,520
you and your team members

283
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,120
can only play games
using an abacus.

284
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,530
I don't play games,

285
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,650
but I know

286
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,610
in the professional e-sports scene,

287
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,040
the key to win the game

288
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,360
is still math.

289
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,360
Am I right?

290
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,340
I always believe that

291
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,100
we didn't choose math

292
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,790
but math chose us.

293
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,780
Oh, my god. He's amazing.

294
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:13,910
Follow up!

295
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,160
He convinced others with his
high IQ. He's really excellent.

296
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,670
Can you be more reserved, Gao Zhi Yi?

297
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,310
Mr Zhang is Yun Shu's husband now.

298
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,750
I'm just reflecting Yun Shu's
inner feelings.

299
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,860
Right, Yun Shu?

300
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,410
Come on.

301
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,760
Are you really angry?

302
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,860
Of course not. Why would I be?

303
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,260
I'm just thinking.

304
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,200
The gap between Mr Zhang and I

305
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,240
is so big.

306
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,440
Kind of.

307
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,880
But it's not a big deal.

308
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,660
You just need to be braver.

309
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,100
I've told you that you
need to show your feelings.

310
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,680
Give him some signals. Did you do that?

311
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,650
Yes.

312
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,040
You did?

313
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,340
What did you do?

314
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,850
I bought him a new lounge wear

315
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,230
using the interest from my investment.

316
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,380
And they're his-and-hers.

317
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,660
Did he take it?

318
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,450
Yes.

319
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,560
Did he say anything?

320
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,240
He said...

321
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,050
"Not bad."

322
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,430
That's it.

323
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,640
What?

324
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,520
You and Mr Zhang are doing it for real.

325
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,360
We have to take further action.

326
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,400
Be more initiative.

327
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,980
You have to make Mr
Zhang feel your presence.

328
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,180
You have to overwhelm him
with your great love.

329
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,590
Who is it? Who hit me?

330
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,780
Do you know how to play basketball?

331
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,260
You didn't see people here?

332
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,630
Sorry. My bad.

333
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,910
Are you OK?

334
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,800
Oh, come on. What department are you in?

335
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,820
Don't be so rude to him.

336
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,960
I'm fine.

337
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,790
Thanks.

338
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,340
Are you really okay?

339
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,830
Let's go to have a check at the hospital.

340
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,710
Oh, come on. You can have a try.

341
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,830
Let me hit you.

342
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,800
You...

343
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,090
I'm really OK. No biggie.

344
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,100
What department are you in?

345
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,630
I've never seen you before.

346
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,100
I've long graduated.

347
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,300
I just came here to run an errand

348
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,830
and just dropped by to play basketball

349
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,600
I'm Gu Xiao.

350
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,810
I'm Gao Zhi Yi.

351
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,980
Can I have your WeChat?

352
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,950
OK.

353
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,040
WeChat me if you have any problem.

354
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,430
Alright, I'll treat you
to dinner some day.

355
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,060
Let's continue.

356
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,400
I'll pick your eyes up from the ground

357
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,560
and put them back,

358
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,260
in case you became blind.

359
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,630
Look. Just as I said.

360
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,780
It's really easy for a
woman to chase after a man.

361
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,310
Yi Yi, wipe your mouth.

362
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,320
I can see your drool.

363
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,490
Oh, come on.

364
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,690
You have to make it clear to me.

365
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,060
What's going on with your divorce?

366
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,830
Mum!

367
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,180
This is my workplace.

368
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,940
I'll tell you everything at home, OK?

369
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,350
No way.

370
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,530
Don't call me mum.

371
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,000
Shame on you.

372
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,180
If you're divorced,

373
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,680
what will you do in the future?

374
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,750
Once you get divorced,

375
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,440
it's not easy for you to
remarry someone else.

376
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,080
If you really dare to get divorced,

377
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,860
I'll cut ties with you.

378
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,630
Mum!

379
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,880
Don't talk nonsense.

380
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:16,850
Miss Shen.

381
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,400
I need you to help me

382
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,650
to adjust the working
schedule for next week.

383
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,990
OK, Professor Zhang.

384
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,730
Hello,

385
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,940
you're Lan Lan's superior, right?

386
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:28,890
Hello.

387
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,130
Alright, listen.

388
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,600
Can you be the judge?

389
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,250
Shen Lan...

390
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,360
Mum.

391
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,890
Just stop.

392
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,460
Miss Shen is an outstanding person.

393
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,070
She's great at logical thinking

394
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,760
or emotional control.

395
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,620
Come on, Mum, let's leave.

396
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,050
Look at you.

397
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,280
Do you know that gossip is dreadful?

398
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,660
You've really let me down.

399
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,940
Alright, I'll go.

400
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,290
Professor Zhang,

401
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,560
can I sit here?

402
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:09,940
Be my guest.

403
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,620
I want to thank you for
what you did for me today.

404
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,440
No worries.

405
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,710
I just told her what I saw.

406
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,860
By the way, Miss Shen,

407
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,830
does a divorce really affect

408
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,960
the modern women vastly?

409
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,920
Hard to say.

410
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,750
But it will exert some
impact more or less.

411
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,650
People won't care too much

412
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,720
about what happened between a couple.

413
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,840
I won't be like Xiang Lin's wife,

414
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,280
so I won't explain everything to everyone.

415
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,650
Therefore,

416
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,530
people will guess

417
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,560
what happened,

418
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,810
and over time,

419
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,160
what the truth is

420
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,330
no longer matters.

421
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,890
Maybe it's just as your mum said just now.

422
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,380
Rumour is dreadful.

423
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,620
Yes.

424
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:16,800
[Yun Shu.]

425
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,280
[You don't have to prepare dinner for me.]

426
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,740
[I'm staying late for work.]

427
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,300
[Gender Relations in
China's Current Social Formation ]

428
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:32,890
What are you doing?

429
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,470
Mr Zhang.

430
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,070
I just finished doing laundry.

431
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,330
I folded your clothes

432
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,850
and put them into your wardrobe.

433
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,680
Mr Zhang,

434
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,790
you still read fairy tales?

435
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,090
That's very kind of you.

436
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,190
You should just take care
of yourself in the future

437
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,050
I can take care of my own affairs.

438
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,020
Okay.

439
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,560
I'll leave you then.

440
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,800
I'm done.

441
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,030
Mr Zhang,

442
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,230
the noodles I cooked
today doesn't taste good?

443
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:23,530
No.

444
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,680
Hold on, Mr Zhang.

445
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,840
After I finish my breakfast,
I'll be right with you.

446
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:33,790
Yun Shu.

447
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,590
From today on,

448
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,650
you don't have to attend my class.

449
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,410
You can study at home.

450
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,340
I'll answer your questions

451
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,240
when I'm home.

452
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,560
Mr Zhang,

453
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,460
did I do something wrong at school

454
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,310
and affected your teaching?

455
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,720
I was just thoughtless.

456
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,610
Our relationship

457
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,340
is likely to have some negative effects.

458
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,440
I indeed neglected

459
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,680
this aspect.

460
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,110
From today on,

461
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,590
we should avoid
showing up together in public,

462
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,650
especially in our shared
social environments

463
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,700
like the school.

464
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,720
Mr Zhang, I…

465
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,850
I'm going to be late.

466
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,510
I have to go.

467
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,000
Hello, is this express delivery?

468
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,100
Yeah.

469
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,040
Please tell me the express code.

470
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,450
5201314.

471
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,600
OK.

472
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,460
I love you all my life.

473
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,570
Don't go.

474
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,660
How did you know my phone number?

475
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,420
There's nothing I can't do.

476
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,280
Childish!

477
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,580
Do you know the difference
between you and a monkey?

478
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,920
One lives in caves.

479
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,100
And another one

480
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,460
lives in my heart.

481
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,560
Listen, you have to go to see a doctor.

482
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:06,930
What the hell do you want from me?

483
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,830
I want to you to be my girlfriend.
You really have a poor memory.

484
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,580
You should go to see a doctor with me.

485
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,520
You can't arouse my hormone.

486
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,060
How could it be?

487
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,060
I'm the prince charming
of 0.5 billion girls.

488
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,100
I'm not a girl.

489
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,290
I also don't dream.

490
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,020
No woman can refuse me

491
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,280
in this world.

492
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,680
Listen, you must think
you're living in a drama.

493
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:35,000
An idol, chick flick

494
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,070
where you are the successful alpha male.

495
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,960
Do you dare to bet with me?

496
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,590
Give me one month.

497
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,400
And I will step into your heart.

498
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,110
I can give you two months

499
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,290
and you won't even step
a foot inside my house.

500
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,260
Deal.

501
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:50,840
What?

502
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,220
I'll get in your house within two months.

503
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:55,690
Hold on.

504
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,770
Don't leave.

505
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,090
This is for you.

506
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,620
You have to take it.

507
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,880
It's a deal, Miss Yun.

508
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,120
Perfect.

509
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,540
Hello,

510
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,410
[Mrs Zhang,]

511
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,140
[when will you come for your photos?]

512
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,040
Photos?

513
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,890
[Yes, you said that]

514
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:54,280
[you would come to get the
photos on Wednesday afternoon.]

515
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,030
I'm so sorry. I forgot.

516
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,430
I'll go now.

517
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,920
I'll be right there.

518
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:04,660
Take it.

519
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,700
It's a bit heavy. Are you OK with it?

520
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,450
Never mind.

521
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,330
Take it easy.

522
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,890
-OK, thanks.
-Bye.

523
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,460
And then?

524
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,650
Then...

525
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:19,880
Nothing else.

526
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:20,920
What?

527
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,260
Nothing else?

528
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,930
It's so strange.

529
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,340
You were so good the day before.

530
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,290
You ate together and you gave him a gift.

531
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,910
Analyse the situation
from a Martian's perspective.

532
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,110
What Martian?

533
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,700
Women are from Venus
and men are from Mars.

534
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,960
Don't you know?

535
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,190
You really know nothing.

536
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,920
Oh, come on.

537
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,390
Listen to me.

538
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,540
You were good the day before.

539
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,510
How did things suddenly change
the next day?

540
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,650
I got it.

541
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,160
I…

542
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,590
Let me change my way of thinking.

543
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,100
I thought in a wrong way just now.

544
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,080
I really got it this time.

545
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,330
Last night, did Mr Zhang say
he'd be working late?

546
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,010
Yes.

547
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,500
So he came home late

548
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,120
and seemed exhausted?

549
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:03,750
Yeah.

550
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,220
That's it.

551
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,280
Men will feel down

552
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,900
or something like that

553
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,400
when they are tired from work.

554
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:11,900
So I guess Mr Zhang is just

555
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,840
too tired from work recently.

556
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,300
Little Lin,

557
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,400
it's the first time
you're giving sound opinion.

558
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,770
You deserve a praise.

559
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:25,910
What's this?

560
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,290
Hey, don't.

561
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,790
Wedding pictures.

562
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,090
Wow, they're so great.

563
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,190
I think Mr Zhang

564
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,680
is just not that into me.

565
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,180
Open your eyes.

566
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,900
Look at the way he looks at you.

567
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,080
Look.

568
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,080
What is it if not love?

569
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,160
What else can it be?

570
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,270
Is it love?

571
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,810
Be his sweetheart and cheer him up.

572
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,560
Make him forget his worries.

573
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,360
How do I do that?

574
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,180
You can be considerate towards him,

575
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,290
take care of him

576
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,790
or just show up in front of him suddenly

577
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:14,160
and give him a surprise.

578
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,230
A surprise?

579
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,380
Is that OK?

580
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,360
Of course.

581
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,540
Why don't you trust me?

582
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,330
Oh, I have to go to my class.

583
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,500
OK, study hard.

584
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,540
Bye.

585
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,890
There is something wrong.

586
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,790
Mr Zhang?

587
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,590
Thanks, Sir.

588
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,380
Miss Shen.

589
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,470
Yun Shu.

590
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,610
Sorry.

591
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,600
Why are you in a hurry?

592
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,590
What are you doing?

593
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,250
Yun Shu.

594
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,290
Mr Zhang.

595
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,390
What are you doing?

596
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,030
Hello, Professor Wu.

597
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,560
I was looking for you.

598
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,170
The academic affairs office

599
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,490
issued a new class table.

600
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,640
I want to discuss with you.

601
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,770
Mr Zhang.

602
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:50,140
Are you angry?

603
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,600
Yun Shu.

604
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,410
This morning I told you

605
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,880
not to go to school

606
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,180
and let more people know
about our relationship.

607
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,530
This will cause a lot
trouble for the future.

608
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,850
Mr Zhang,

609
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,510
why don't you want others

610
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,300
to know about us?

611
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,530
You look down on me?

612
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,699
How can you have this logic?

613
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:15,530
Mr Zhang,

614
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,560
you're better than me in all aspects.

615
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,929
I'm not good enough for you

616
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,239
though I signed a contract with you.

617
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,650
How did you come to this conclusion?

618
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,679
I didn't mean that.

619
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,500
So why are you afraid of the exposure

620
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,040
of our relationship?

621
00:32:33,139 --> 00:32:33,790
Afraid?

622
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,679
First,

623
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,179
I'm not afraid to let others
know of our relationship.

624
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,210
Second,

625
00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:40,280
I just don't want more people

626
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,850
know our relationship,

627
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,300
because once our deal is over

628
00:32:43,389 --> 00:32:45,110
and more people know about us,

629
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,830
it is likely that your future

630
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,840
relationships and
marriage will be affected.

631
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,550
My future?

632
00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:51,710
My relationships

633
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,630
and marriage?

634
00:32:55,489 --> 00:32:56,370
Yun Shu.

635
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,960
This contract may influence your

636
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,180
reputation to some extent.

637
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,090
I was thoughtless.

638
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,730
But don't worry.

639
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,730
I'll draft a supplemental agreement.

640
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,710
So if your future boyfriend
and husband misunderstands,

641
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:13,760
I'll explain everything to them.

642
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,800
Mr Zhang.

643
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,790
So all along,

644
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,920
you just thought of me
as your Party B, right?

645
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,350
In this contract,

646
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,230
we are indeed Party A and Party B.

647
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,690
OK, I got it.

648
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,930
[Easter Egg Time]

649
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,670
Thanks.

650
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,360
Here, here. Come on

651
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,350
I'm here.

652
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,290
We're going to have a fancy lunch.

653
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,890
-Those dishes...
-Hey.

654
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,180
What's wrong?

655
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,540
You two jumped the queue.

656
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:40,800
What?

657
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:42,130
I said you jumped the queue

658
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,030
so you should go to the end of the line.

659
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,810
Miss, what's the big deal?
Don't make a fuss.

660
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,810
Just shut it.

661
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,790
Yeah.

662
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,260
Yes, shut it.

663
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,240
Mr Zhang.

664
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,480
It's peak lunch hour.

665
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,930
They are 12 people queuing up.

666
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,980
If each one takes
two and a half minutes to order,

667
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,700
and you passed 11 people,

668
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,260
that means
you saved 27 and a half minutes.

669
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,340
You two occupied
the time of the other 11 students,

670
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,930
five minutes per person.

671
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,780
Do you still think it's not a big deal?

672
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,170
Sorry, Mr Zhang.

673
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,730
Thank you, Mr Zhang.

674
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,060
I want that one.

675
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:29,820
Come with me.
