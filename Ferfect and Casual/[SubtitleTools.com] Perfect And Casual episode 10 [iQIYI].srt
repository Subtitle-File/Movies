00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,200
I'll explain everything

to them.

9
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,079
You just take me as your Party B, right?

10
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:23,510
In this contract,

11
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,350
we are Party A and Party B.

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,560

15
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,310
I want to talk with you.

I can't understand you.

22

What's going on?

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,010
I let you give him signals

24
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,060
while you moved out.

25
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,510
I think Mr Zhang doesn't like me.

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,800
You told him your feelings?

27
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,510
No.

28

our relationship.

31
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,550
It's obvious.

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,480
It's alright.

33
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,240
You don't have to move out.

34
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,810
You should just stay away from him.

35
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,390
I think my sister is right.

36
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,360
The psychological distance

37
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,280
begins with the physical distance.

38
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,310
And if I am bogged down in

39
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,300
that negative emotion deeper and deeper,

40
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,550
I will influence Mr Zhang.

41
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,280
Oh, save it.

42
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,620
Stop thinking of Mr Zhang.

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,220
You've totally lost your heart.

44
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,160
No.

45
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:26,140
I like Mr Zhang

46
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,390

47

49

How about going back to my dormitory

I'm so hungry.

58

195
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,560
Open the door.

196
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,960
Come on, forgive him.

197
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,090
You...

198
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,690
Thanks.

199
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:10,890
Bro, get in.

200
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,370
You're beautiful.

201
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,890
You have poor sleep.

202
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,280
I have to introduce a doctor to you.

203
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,900
Get out or shut up.

204
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,190
Hello, Senior.

205
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,310
I'm done working.

206
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,950
OK, see you later.

207
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,120
Look.

208
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,470
I made it.

209
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,190
It's harmful to drink Lemonade.

210
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,550
You had a good sleep last night?

211
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,310
Looks like my TV series

212
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,940
isn't completely useless.

213
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,660
Time to eat.

214
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,460
We can only sleep in on weekends.

215
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,420
Why did you get up so early?

216
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,300
It's the weekend.

217
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:14,790
Mei, go ahead.

218
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,940
I have to go.

219
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,590
You're really hilarious, Mr Zhang.

220
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,740
Show me the thermometer.

221
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,430
Mr Zhang is here.

222
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,870
Mr Zhang is in a good shape now.

223
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,100
You can talk with him.

224
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,540
Okay, thank you.

225
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,710
It's good to see that the
temperature went down.

226
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,220
Where is Yun Shu?

227
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,820
Did you fight?

228
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,700
Today, Yun Shu...

229
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,090
Grandpa.

230
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,350
Grandpa, I'm here.

231
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,780
She'll be a bit late.

232
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,310
Yes, I was held up by something.

233
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:11,950
However,

234
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,120
nothing is more important

235
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,820
than grandpa.

236
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,350
Yun Shu, you're really honey-lipped.

237
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,350
Look.

238
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,110
The blood pressure goes down immediately.

239
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,520
Grandpa, have a guess.

240
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,420
What have I got for you today?

241
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,510
What?

242
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,790
Durian.

243
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,350
Grandpa.

244
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,710
Ever since you told me that

245
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,670
you want to eat durian,

246
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,260
I bought the freshest one for you.

247
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,270
You're so sweet, Yun Shu.

248
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:41,960
Grandpa,

249
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,120
I'll cut one up for you to try.

250
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:43,610
Okay.

251
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,570
Alright.

252
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,990
The durian...

253
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,700
Si Nian, she's a girl.

254
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,120
It's hard for her to deal with the durian.

255
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,350
Go help her.

256
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,080
Let me do it.

257
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,010
Yun Shu.

258
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,869
Thank you for coming
here to visit grandpa.

259
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,359
Don't mention it. It's my duty.

260
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,310
I told you that I'll

261
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,620
follow the contract.

262
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,100
After all, grandpa gave you...

263
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,980
Never mind, I got a job.

264
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,740
I can support myself.

265
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,170
What kind of job?

266
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,950
A sale at a supermarket.

267
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,590
Huimin Supermarket,
not far away from home.

268
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,680
A sale at the supermarket?

269
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,020
Sale of beers.

270
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,620
I have a day off on Thursday.

271
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,830
Meals and accommodation included.

272
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,300
I have a basic salary
and commission from sales.

273
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,060
I think I understand now.

274
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,030
Understand what?

275
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,000
You're doing this to make yourself

276
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,500
more independent, aren't you?

277
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,860
I respect your choice.

278
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,550
But it's a hard way.

279
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,920
But since you've chosen it,

280
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,340
just stick to it. I believe you.

281
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,410
Go ahead.

282
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,190
Hello, director.

283
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,840
[Special offer]

284
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,350
Hello, hello.

285
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,150
Have a look at the beer promotions.

286
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,670
Buy a dozen and get a dozen free.

287
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,270
Girl, does the beer taste good?

288
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,910
Yes, have a try.

289
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,180
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

290
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,390
What are you doing?

291
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,910
Mr Zhang, why are you here?

292
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,710
I come to give you the exercises.

293
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:43,890
What's going on?

294
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,510
My sister is here.

295
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,420
I can't let her know
that I'm working here.

296
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,180
Don't look at her.

297
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,550
What to do then?

298
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,110
She's coming here.

299
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,340
What are you doing here?

300
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,430
Sis, why are you here?

301
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,940
To shop, of course.

302
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,950
Si Nian and I also want to buy something.

303
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,240
Si Nian said he wants to drink beer,

304
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,470
so I came here with him.

305
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,840
The beer was made from selected
wheat, imported with original packaging.

306
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,870
It's super rich.

307
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,340
Shall we buy a dozen?

308
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,140
I say, why do you dress so...

309
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,100
Here you are. They are for Yun Shu.

310
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,360
Thanks.

311
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,080
Sis.

312
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,860
Yun Shu, come with me.

313
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,990
What's going on, sis?

314
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,500
Zhang Si Nian is a nice guy.

315
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,230
Your sis...

316
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,310
She's gone. She didn't see the cracks.

317
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,110
Mr Zhang, thank you.

318
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,150
Don't mention it.

319
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,390
Because Article 5 in the contract

320
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,150
points out...

321
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,350
Yun Shu, the director is looking for you.

322
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,120
Go.

323
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,090
Mr Zhang,

324
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,230
thank you.

325
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,280
I can take care of myself.

326
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,230
Rest assured.

327
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:27,870
I have to go.

328
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,160
Come on! Come on!

329
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,130
I'm off now.

330
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,800
[Pocket file]

331
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,700
You begged to give you an opportunity.

332
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,290
And you promised me that you can do well.

333
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,280
So?

334
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,300
What did you do?

335
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,990
You offended our customer.

336
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,470
And you just ran away
after stepping on his feet.

337
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,640
Then you left for a while.

338
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,380
You didn't sell anything.

339
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,510
Sorry, director.

340
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,230
Please let me explain.

341
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,590
It really was an accident.

342
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,590
An accident?

343
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,860
You're my accident.

344
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,420
Listen, Yun Shu.

345
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,630
What do you want?

346
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,950
You're an undergraduate.

347
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,190
You work at our supermarket

348
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,110
for more experience of life?

349
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:08,850
No, director.

350
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:09,470
Listen to me,

351
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,440
I didn't mean that.

352
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,790
Go to the finance department
and get your salary settled.

353
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,600
This place

354
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,980
isn't big enough for you.

355
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,390
I'll get it done in 6 hours.

356
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,990
Please give me one more chance.

357
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,880
Though she's a casual labourer,

358
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,260
she shall be noticed in advance.

359
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,280
Or you'll disobey the
regulations of Labour Law.

360
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,420
Who are you?

361
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,700
It's none of your business.

362
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,310
He's my teacher.

363
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,500
I'm her husband.

364
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,830
I'm begging you.

365
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,680
Please give me another chance.

366
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,240
I must finish the task.

367
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,190
The last chance.

368
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:45,900
It's definitely my last chance.

369
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,040
OK

370
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,910
Thanks, sir.

371
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,070
Thanks, sir.

372
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,680
I'm here.

373
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,510
Okay.

374
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,670
Go, go, go.

375
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,680
How about having some midnight snacks?

376
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,920
Not today.

377
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,800
I have to go home.

378
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,280
Why not finish our meals first?

379
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,970
It's OK. How about tomorrow?

380
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,720
Bye.

381
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,200
Bye. See you tomorrow.

382
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,220
I've changed the password.

383
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,180
What are you doing here?

384
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:04,870
I was off from work.

385
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,580
I drop by to check whether
you're still alive or not.

386
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,700
Come on. Are you ill?

387
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,740
Is there something wrong
between you and Yun Shu?

388
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,310
Yun Shu moved out.

389
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,830
Yun Shu ran away from you?

390
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,630
Watch your words.

391
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,940
She didn't "run away."

392
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,590
She just moved out.

393
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,310
What? Why?

394
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,870
I think we should keep some distance.

395
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,300
It's good for both of us.

396
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,530
Come on!

397
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,860
Did you do anything strange to her?

398
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,400
I just told her that we
should keep our distance

399
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,710
in front of other people.

400
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
It may be good for everyone.

401
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,380
She offered to move out

402
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,590
without my permission.

403
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,640
Yes.

404
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,160
So you get to keep your distance

405
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,340
from her like you wished.

406
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,320
Are you happy now?

407
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,420
How are you feeling now?

408
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,820
Not happy.

409
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,760
I

410
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,510
miss her.

411
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,630
Nian Nian, you're falling in love.

412
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,830
Nonsense.

413
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:35,720
Come on!

414
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,550
Yun Shu,

415
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,900
I just don't get it.

416
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:40,200
You are almost OK with everything.

417
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,190
But you're so stubborn

418
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,540
in the moving-out thing, why?

419
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,230
Because I think I don't want to

420
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,260
make do with my affection.

421
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,430
Mr Zhang doesn't love me,

422
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,150
so I can't stay at his home

423
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,260
and make trouble for him.

424
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,260
I also made trouble for myself.

425
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,110
Why are you staring at me?

426
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,180
You've changed.

427
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,870
You do seem kind of different.

428
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:05,190
All right,

429
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,630
forget those unhappy things.

430
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,020
I got my bonus.

431
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,870
How about having dinner together?

432
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,430
I have to go to work at the supermarket.

433
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,020
Have fun. I have to go.

434
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:13,870
Alright.

435
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,800
Bye

436
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:15,780
I'll hang out with you when I'm free.

437
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,400
Let's have dinner together.

438
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,590
No. I'll wait for Gu Xiao.

439
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,740
Gu Xiao?

440
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,990
You've met just once

441
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,320
within one minute.

442
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,470
And you have a crush on him.

443
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,680
Do you know him?

444
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,320
He may be a fraud,

445
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,370
a playboy,

446
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,550
or an outlaw.

447
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,840
Shut up.

448
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,040
I have made inquiries.

449
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,570
Gu Xiao is a nice man.

450
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,480
Perfect.

451
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:37,240
How?

452
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,640
After he graduated from our college,

453
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:39,780
he furthered his studies abroad.

454
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,310
He founded his own technology
company last year at home.

455
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,470
He's low-profile and gentle

456
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,930
with great ambition and lofty goals.

457
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,180
I don't buy the hearsay.

458
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,640
Seeing is believing.

459
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,260
Yi Yi.

460
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,360
Seeing is better than hearing.

461
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,620
Are you missing me?

462
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,800
OK!

463
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,240
OK

464
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,300
It's of course useful.

465
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,260
Yun Shu.

466
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,620
Yun Shu, we have to rehearse before we go

467
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,500
to visit grandpa in the future

468
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,230
otherwise grandpa may see the cracks.

469
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,590
Alright?

470
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,960
Got it, Mr Zhang

471
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,830
I'll tell you what I say to
grandpa through WeChat

472
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,720
in the future.

473
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,190
It's more than that.

474
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,460
If you have any trouble,

475
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,660
feel free to contact me at WeChat.

476
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,230
I'm always here.

477
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,630
Ok.

478
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,080
OK

479
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,500
Hello, Sir.

480
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,290
Do you want to get to know our beer?

481
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,040
They are our new arrivals.

482
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,240
Can you drink beer?

483
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,150
Not really.

484
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,160
But our beers

485
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,330
taste good.

486
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:13,640
Girl who can drink beer
has stories deep inside.

487
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,190
But I have no stories.

488
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,120
I'm not asking you
to tell your stories.

489
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,740
I'll pour you a sample. Have a try.

490
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,670
They are fresh

491
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,780
and they taste good.

492
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,810
The aroma of wheat makes me feel warm.

493
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,240
If you feel warm,

494
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,910
how about taking some
bottles of beer home?

495
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,470
I should drink warm beer

496
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,990
with a warm girl like you.

497
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,620
That's the drinking culture.

498
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,600
But I'm ill-educated.

499
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,220
Listen.

500
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,280
The drinking culture of China

501
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:57,110
originated from the Yangshao Culture
6,000 years ago.

502
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,070
Do you know that?

503
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,270
Yangshao...

504
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,750
The Law on the Protection of Women's
Rights and Interests

505
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,120
was revised in 2005.

506
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,440
It is clearly presented the
concept of sexual harassment.

507
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:04,990
Who are you?

508
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,050
Are you insane?

509
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,460
It's doesn't matter who I am?

510
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,070
The point is I know

511
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,410
according to Article 42, Paragraph 5

512
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:11,470
of the Law of PRC

513
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,110
on Public Security Administration.

514
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,380
Are you insane?

515
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,410
Yes. Watch out.

516
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,540
Thank you.

517
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,930
You can call the police

518
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,040
or ask for help

519
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,430
if you bump into this kind of situation.

520
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,010
I got it. Thank you very much.

521
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,180
Don't thank me.

522
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:33,610
Are you going to just take it
next time you run into such a situation?

523
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,560
I know people like him.

524
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,080
Most of the time, they
just want to harass you.

525
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,060
But if you ignore them, they'll walk away.

526
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,770
If you confront them head-on,

527
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,900
it'll affect your work.

528
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,580
After all,

529
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,770
those cans of beer should be to blame.

530
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,860
Sir,

531
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,970
thank you very much

532
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:55,710
I'm going to

533
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,180
work for the beer.

534
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,100
How about you looking around?

535
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:15,600
Director.

536
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,360
You're looking for me?

537
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,900
Yes, Yun Shu.

538
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,060
One customer ordered 20 boxes of beer.

539
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,240
Go with the delivery man later.

540
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,220
This is the address.

541
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:25,920
I...

542
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,510
The customer assigned you

543
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,530
20 boxes.

544
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:29,520
Just get out there

545
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,500
and you should meet your quota
for this month.

546
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,830
I think I've been to this place.

547
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,670
Really?

548
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,790
That's even better.

549
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,480
I'll let Wang of the logistics department

550
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,130
go with you.

551
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,220
Don't worry.

552
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,080
Thank you, director.

553
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,470
Yun Shu.

554
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,310
You made great progress recently.

555
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,410
Keep working hard.

556
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:49,790
Then I'm off now.

557
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,760
Okay.

558
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,640
Hello,

559
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,280
Hello, may I help you?

560
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,080
Hello, I'm from Huimin Supermarket.

561
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,680
I'm here to deliver

562
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:05,740
beer.

563
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,210
Yes.

564
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,600
Hold on. Let me make a phone call.

565
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,560
Okay.

566
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,510
Mr Meng. The one you
made appointments with is here.

567
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,680
OK

568
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,290
In the office at the corner.

569
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,620
Get in directly.

570
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,530
My beer is downstairs.

571
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,050
I'm here to deliver...

572
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:20,750
Never mind

573
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,040
I'll do it myself.

574
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,350
Just go in.

575
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,320
Okay.

576
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,190
Are you here for the interview?

577
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,480
I'm from Huimin Supermarket
to deliver beer for you.

578
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,510
Beer delivery?

579
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,000
Would you like to have a shot
at an interview with us?

580
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,220
Mr Meng.

581
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:52,760
Mr Meng.

582
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,180
You're the guy in the supermarket.

583
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,890
You're the company's...

584
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,930
Yes, want to have a try.

585
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,610
Hello, Yun Shu.

586
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:12,429
Hello, Mr Zhang.

587
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,830
Are you busy now?

588
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,420
Say it.

589
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:17,570
I have good news.

590
00:32:17,739 --> 00:32:19,380
I got a new job

591
00:32:19,469 --> 00:32:21,000
as an assistant at a law office.

592
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,969
I just passed the
interview this afternoon.

593
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,070
Congratulations!

594
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,650
Actually, I just want to tell you

595
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,870
that I'll be visiting grandpa
this afternoon.

596
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:33,909
I was afraid you might not know,

597
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,690
so I thought I'd notify you in advance.

598
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,110
Grandpa will be happy for you.

599
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,190
Come on.

600
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,310
Well, goodbye, Mr Zhang.

601
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,219
OK, bye.

602
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:52,980
You want to help her

603
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,250
but why do you hide it from her?

604
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,900
For Yun Shu,

605
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,449
me not helping her is the
greatest help.

606
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,320
I didn't expect that so many
years after graduation,

607
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,420
you'd come to see me

608
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,390
about your marriage contract.

609
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,620
You really trust me.

610
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,640
All the time, I trust your ability.

611
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,430
Yun Shu is so common.

612
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,460
She looks average

613
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,500
and not very smart.

614
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,980
Your type is special.

615
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,960
So in the future,

616
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,090
I hope you can help her at work.

617
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,590
Though we were competing for

618
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,800
the first place at school,

619
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,530
I always think we are in the same group.

620
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,940
So we can understand each other.

621
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,220
But after I saw Yun Shu,

622
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,450
I realized that maybe.

623
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,590
I never saw through you.

624
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,440
It doesn't matter.

625
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,680
Have you eaten yet?

626
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:44,850
Let me buy you a meal

627
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,310
as a thank-you.

628
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,920
OK.

629
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,460
I want to eat fried chicken.

630
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,980
The dining hall, then.

631
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,210
[Easter Egg Time]

632
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,510
Hello,

633
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,850
want to buy beer?

634
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:45,850
Mr Zhang,

635
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,810
why are you back?

636
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,180
Why are you taking them?

637
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,420
I want to help you sell beer.

638
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,230
Beer and diapers?

639
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,610
Why?

640
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,400
Come with me.

641
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:17,180
Walmart, the world's biggest retailer

642
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:19,160
once presented an interesting case.

643
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,560
That is, put beer and diapers together

644
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,990
and they are for sale together.

645
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,090
And sales volume showed that

646
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,580
the sales of beer were better

647
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,770
because it was with diapers.

648
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,310
Later, after their
analysis, they found that

649
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,910
many young dads

650
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,990
would shop at the
supermarket for their wives.

651
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,130
After they bought living goods

652
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,120
and diapers,

653
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,600
they would drop by to buy some beer.

654
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,210
Like this.

655
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,430
So according to the
analysis of statistics,

656
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,850
the proper adjustment
of goods distribution

657
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:47,770
can effectively change

658
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,540
the sales volume.

659
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,510
Awesome.
