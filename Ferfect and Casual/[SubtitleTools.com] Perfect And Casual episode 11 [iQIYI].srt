[Adapted from Wanzhi's
"Perfect and Casual"]

2
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,230
Are you here for an interview?

3
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,329
I'm from Huimin Supermarket
to deliver beer for you.

4
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,079
Deliver beer?

5
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,840
Do you want to interview
at our company?

6
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:33,920
Mr Meng.

7
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:36,630
Mr Meng?

8
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,760
You're the person

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,180
who bought beer in the supermarket, right?

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,530
You're the company's...

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,740
Yes, want to have a try?

12
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,540
Hello, Yun Shu.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,210
Hello, Mr Zhang.

14
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,610
Are you busy now?

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,260
No, what is it?

16
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,329
I have good news.

17
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,140
I got a new job,

18
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,740
being an assistant at a law office.

19
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,630
I just passed the
interview this afternoon.

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,920
Congratulations!

21
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,820
Actually,

22
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,360
I just want to tell you

23
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,740
that I'll go to visit grandpa.

24
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,610
In case you didn't know,

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,690
I decided to inform you beforehand.

26
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,200
Grandpa will be happy for you.

27
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,010
Come on.

28
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,070
Well, goodbye, Mr Zhang.

29
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,070
[Okay, bye.]

30
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,070
[Emergency]

31
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,079
Did you fall in love recently?

32
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,050
Yes.

33
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,440
Interesting.

34
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,230
The grandpa seems to
be in a good mood lately.

35
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,310
This is fun.

36
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,590
What's the matter?

37
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,250
Something on your mind?

38
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,690
No.

39
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,380
Grandpa,

40
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,010
you said my strength

41
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,260
is being heartless.

42
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,340
So nothing is on my mind.

43
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,940
Don't forget that rich experiences
make a person have a penetrating insight.

44
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,810
Did anything unpleasant happen

45
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,650
between you and Si Nian?

46
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,360
No, no.

47
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,870
No.

48
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,100
I do have something on my mind.

49
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,060
Well, I have found a job

50
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,740
of being an assistant at a law firm.

51
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,940
But

52
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,159
I actually have no confidence in myself

53
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,409
and don't know if I can do it well.

54
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,200
Is that all?

55
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,690
There's no false statement.

56
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,110
That year when I just went abroad

57
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,730
there were Americans and Europeans

58
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,740
around my supervisor.

59
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,280
They didn't believe the Chinese

60
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,300
could do mathematical research.

61
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,140
In the face of these doubts,

62
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,610
I began to doubt myself, too.

63
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,600
I even thought of

64
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,300
changing majors

65
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,670
or dropping out.

66
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,320
Later,

67
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,880
my supervisor read the air.

68
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,490
One day he called me to his office.

69
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,490
He pointed to a pile of
papers on the table, saying,

70
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,620
"Zhang, look,

71
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,370
these are all applications
from those PhD candidates.

72
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,940
But I only chose you

73
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,910
from the pile of applications.

74
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,870
So please believe your excellence

75
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,500
and my insight."

76
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,190
Yun Shu,

77
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,570
you should believe that

78
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,060
there's always a reason

79
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,820
for one person to choose another person.

80
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,740
Maybe it's just

81
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,659
that the person in question
can't figure it out.

82
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,700
Grandpa,

83
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,570
I got it.

84
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,820
I'll try my best.

85
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,130
Yun Shu,

86
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,740
I want to ask you

87
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,190
for a favour.

88
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,690
No problem.

89
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,020
Tell me.

90
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,210
[Everything okay at work?]

91
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,290
[Academician Zhang: Professor Zhang,
please come to the hospital tomorrow]

92
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,150
[A seafront villa.]

93
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,210
[Sure enough,]

94
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,320
[a book holds a house of gold.]

95
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,710
[How long will it take
to finish cleaning up]

96
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,700
[such a big house?]

97
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,419
Mr Zhang.

98
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,539
Why are you here?

99
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,400
Academician Zhang.

100
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,990
Why didn't you tell me in advance

101
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,710
you'd come over?

102
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,670
I...

103
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,060
I forgot.

104
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,260
Actually, I was thinking
since you're usually busy,

105
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,580
I didn't want to disturb you

106
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,240
with such a trivial matter.

107
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:11,800
Mr Zhang,

108
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,410
let's clean the house up.

109
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,540
It's too big.

110
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,320
We won't finish cleaning
it up unless we start now.

111
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,710
Yun Shu.

112
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,860
Congratulations on your new job.

113
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,930
Let's get started.

114
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:58,850
♫ Turning off the lights
in search of its trace ♫

115
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,610
♫ I walk steadily
on the path beneath my feet ♫

116
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,930
♫ I hear someone asking,
are you still here? ♫

117
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,620
Be careful.

118
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:17,050
♫ The kind person replies,
I've always been here ♫

119
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,120
I got the high positions.

120
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,690
♫ This love cuts through the crowd
in search of me ♫

121
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,540
♫ It isn't easy ♫

122
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,730
♫ I only wish to cherish it with you ♫

123
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,570
♫ Each and every moment ♫

124
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:34,860
♫ If I missed out, I will meet you again
in another lifetime ♫

125
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,210
[Welcome Home, Grandpa!]

126
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:41,970
♫ I recognise your eyes,
a secret that belongs to me ♫

127
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:10,600
♫ The night will pass,
I am the dawn ♫

128
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:16,480
♫ Protecting this innocence,
evident in your eyes ♫

129
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,790
♫ I hear someone asking,
do dreams come to an end? ♫

130
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,600
♫ I will keep you company in
the future, never letting go ♫

131
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,980
Yun Shu.

132
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,810
Mr Zhang.

133
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,760
Yun Shu.

134
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,710
We don't have to clean this room.

135
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,110
Mr Zhang, I saw a lot of

136
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,780
pictures of your childhood.

137
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,990
You were so cute.

138
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,860
So you read fairy tales
when you were a child?

139
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,570
Sorry, Mr Zhang.

140
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,940
I didn't mean to go through your things.

141
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,070
You go out first.

142
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,300
Okay.

143
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,410
I'll clean the other room.

144
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,380
Okay.

145
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,160
Yun Shu.

146
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,840
Yun Shu.

147
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,030
What's the matter?

148
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:20,970
Come here.

149
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,740
What's the matter?

150
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,670
Wall. On the wall...

151
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,510
There's something on
the wall. Do you see it?

152
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,740
Where?

153
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,920
There's something

154
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,390
on the wall, two o'clock direction.

155
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,970
You mean this gecko?

156
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,000
Please

157
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,140
take it out.

158
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,210
Okay.

159
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,140
Can you be faster?

160
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,140
Take it out.

161
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,590
It's gone.

162
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,960
Take it away. Now!

163
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,240
You don't like it?

164
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:07,830
Now!

165
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,290
Now!

166
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,150
This way.

167
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,300
Thank you.

168
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,190
So this is the front door.

169
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,000
Which door did you come in from?

170
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,560
I came in through the
back door facing the beach.

171
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,630
I didn't like to walk through
this door when I was a kid

172
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,650
and I liked to go in
from the door you said.

173
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,950
Then we have the same habit.

174
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,370
Let me drive you home.

175
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,490
Actually,

176
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,710
I'm thinking to take a stroll

177
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,310
on the beach for a while.

178
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,160
Okay.

179
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,310
I'll accompany you.

180
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,160
Sorry.

181
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,020
Hello, Miss Shen.

182
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,190
Urgent meeting?

183
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,720
Okay. I'll get back as soon as possible.

184
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,580
It's alright.

185
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,920
Go on with your work.

186
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,670
I can go by myself.

187
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,070
Okay.

188
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,530
Let me know when you get home.

189
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,060
Be safe.

190
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,390
[Are you still at the seaside?]

191
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,670
[The low tide coastline
is really beautiful.]

192
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,610
[Go home early.]

193
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,200
[I'll take you to enjoy next time.]

194
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:35,480
[Okay.]

195
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,790
Be careful.

196
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,720
Slow down. Be careful.

197
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,370
Do you feel happy?

198
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,280
[On Sunday morning,]

199
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,850
[I'll get Grandpa from
the hospital with you.]

200
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,300
[We said before to make a
unified "oral confession".]

201
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,200
[But I forgot.]

202
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,170
Professor Zhang.

203
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,260
I think you are different from before.

204
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,180
Different?

205
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,360
What's different?

206
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,440
I feel you're happier

207
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,460
than when I first met you.

208
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,430
Happier?

209
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,690
Because of Yun Shu, right?

210
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,190
Miss Shen,

211
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,780
I think you may have misunderstood.

212
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,160
My relationship with Yun Shu

213
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,020
isn't the kind you think.

214
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,410
The two of us signed a
contractual agreement

215
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,490
for some particular reasons.

216
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,030
Contractual agreement?

217
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,640
Yes.

218
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,820
Our relationship will be dissolved

219
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,620
when the agreement expires one year later.

220
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,940
So please

221
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,630
help me keep it a secret.

222
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,200
So that day

223
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,490
you asked about the effects
of divorce on women.

224
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,150
It was because of Yun Shu, right?

225
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,170
Yes.

226
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,080
And thank you for reminding me.

227
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,170
Yun Shu and I have made it very clear.

228
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,810
In front of outsiders,

229
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,930
we'd try to keep distance

230
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,030
and pretend to be strangers.

231
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,300
Professor Zhang.

232
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,310
I know you are always
thinking for others.

233
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,840
But you can't treat girls

234
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,200
like that.

235
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,440
What do you mean "like that"?

236
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,940
[Girl]

237
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,170
[judge by feeling.]

238
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,330
[You need to tell the whole story clearly]

239
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,490
[or they'll misunderstand.]

240
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,940
Sir, I have something to report.

241
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,130
So you mean,

242
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,290
I need to explain my motives
clearly to Yun Shu?

243
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,260
Sure.

244
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,270
Girls always overthink.

245
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,720
Thank you.

246
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,090
You're welcome.

247
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,660
What?

248
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,830
You quit your job?

249
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,320
Where do you live now?

250
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,240
I made a deal with the supervisor.

251
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:09,770
I'm working until the weekend.

252
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:11,420
And I'll check in the
law firm next Monday.

253
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,520
There are dormitories.

254
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:13,869
I can live there.

255
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,670
Update me on what's been going on
with you and Mr Zhang.

256
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,250
Mr Zhang and me?

257
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,500
I feel a little...

258
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,220
Yun Shu.

259
00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:31,860
I think

260
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,720
you've won.

261
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,050
I won?

262
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,870
Mr Zhang is regretting it.

263
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,580
Mr Zhang must be very reluctant

264
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,110
since you ran away from home.

265
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,040
But he's also reluctant
to welcome you back.

266
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,550
So, he took every opportunity

267
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,850
to show up in front of you.

268
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,780
That can't be true.

269
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,080
It has to be.

270
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,110
Okay, stop.

271
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,140
Tell me

272
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,700
what's happening between you and Gu Xiao.

273
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,720
We...

274
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,790
are in an ambiguous phase.

275
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,040
Ambiguous phase?

276
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,210
What stage is that?

277
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,980
It's the same thing
as you and Mr Zhang.

278
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,910
How can you ask so many detailed things?

279
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,930
Now I'm embarrassed.

280
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,770
I can't understand without details.

281
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,750
Well...

282
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,560
Imagine it yourself.

283
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,950
Ambiguous phase?

284
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,650
Have you gone through
the customer details?

285
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,750
Yes.

286
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,860
Everyone, listen to Miss Lan.

287
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,010
Has the customer arrived yet?

288
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,030
Yes.

289
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,920
It seems that someone is filming.

290
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,890
It's Lu Yu.

291
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,180
It's really Lu Yu!

292
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,110
Xiao Li, let me explain.

293
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,300
Cut.

294
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,260
Come on. What's wrong with you?

295
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,080
Can you make it more real?

296
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,760
Hit for real!

297
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,010
Okay, one more.

298
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,980
One more...

299
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,800
One more time.

300
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,490
Alright. Get ready.

301
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,300
You've gone too far.

302
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,690
Xiao Li, let me explain.

303
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,370
How could you betray me?

304
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,580
Cut.

305
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,270
It's okay if there's no technical problem.

306
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,300
Work on this immediately.

307
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,010
Director, one more take.

308
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,640
I wasn't in a good state.

309
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,020
Once more? Can you take it?

310
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,100
I'm young, I'm fine.

311
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,130
One more take.

312
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,300
Fine.

313
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,410
Thank you, senior.

314
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,820
I'll definitely try my best.

315
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,970
All right, all departments get ready.

316
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,240
Xiao Li, let me explain.

317
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,580
How could you betray me?

318
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,420
Cut.

319
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,170
Okay.

320
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:25,920
Next scene.

321
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,880
Good.

322
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,300
Let's go to the meeting.

323
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,560
Before

324
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,820
I thought I'd never come back.

325
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,990
It's like a lifetime ago

326
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,000
as I walk in.

327
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,960
Academician Zhang.

328
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,520
You can't joke about this.

329
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,040
Why is it a joke?

330
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,420
Sincere words.

331
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,720
-Grandpa.
-Sit down.

332
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,570
Grandpa, look.

333
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,790
Is the home particularly clean?

334
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,180
And are you in a better mood now?

335
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,570
Of course.

336
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,080
I got you two here,

337
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,760
so I feel good.

338
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,430
Grandpa, are you hungry?

339
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,630
I'll cook for you.

340
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,160
-Okay.
-Please wait here.

341
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,640
There will be a lot of
delicious food tonight.

342
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,330
It's more comfortable to be at home.

343
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,990
Mr Zhang.

344
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,520
Where's grandpa?

345
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,770
Grandpa said he wanted to read some books.

346
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,670
Let me help you.

347
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,190
Then help me cut

348
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,330
the vegetables I washed.

349
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,300
Okay.

350
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,450
Let me help you.

351
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,790
It's fine. I can do it myself.

352
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,610
It's okay. Let me do it.

353
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,050
Thank you.

354
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,030
I heard from Miss Shen

355
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,340
that sudden marriages

356
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,800
and divorces

357
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,490
have a particularly bad impact on girls.

358
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,800
I don't want you

359
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,450
to suffer any harm from the outside world.

360
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,240
Okay, I got it.

361
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,720
Before,

362
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,330
I overthought.

363
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,710
No.

364
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,230
Before,

365
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,860
I was thoughtless.

366
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,980
Grandpa, the meal is not ready yet.

367
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,870
I want to ask you two

368
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,520
to sleep over with me.

369
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,910
Go back tomorrow, okay?

370
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,180
-Okay.
-No.

371
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,260
Okay. Grandpa, no problem.

372
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,760
Yun Shu.

373
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,430
What's on your mind?

374
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,930
Grandpa.

375
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,300
It's late.

376
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,600
Why haven't you slept yet?

377
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,560
Old people habits.

378
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,440
They're hungry, afraid of death

379
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:49,590
and don't want to sleep.

380
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,370
There is still rice.

381
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,610
-I'll heat it for you.
-No.

382
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,270
I'll just eat two pieces of this.

383
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,390
Grandpa,

384
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,640
I have a question to ask you.

385
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,650
Go ahead.

386
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,110
Does Mr Zhang

387
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,260
not like Andersen's Fairy Tales?

388
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,340
Why did you suddenly ask this?

389
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,790
When I was cleaning up in the
guest room on the second floor,

390
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,850
I accidentally saw
an Andersen's Fairy Tales book.

391
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,510
Several pages were scribbled on.

392
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,940
I think that was intentional.

393
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,200
So...

394
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,890
The Daughter of the Sea.

395
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,960
That's Si Nian's

396
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,570
favourite fairy tale

397
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,850
and the biggest pain in his heart.

398
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,770
[When Si Nian was four years old,]

399
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,650
[his parents went abroad
to participate in an academic research.]

400
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,880
[They planned to come back
during summer vacation at first.]

401
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,940
[Si Nian had hoped his mother
would come back early every day.]

402
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,780
[But in the end...]

403
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,090
[When I saw Si Nian,]

404
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,460
I really didn't have the
courage to tell him the truth.

405
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,360
[So I used his favourite
bedtime fairy tale]

406
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,860
[to coax him.]

407
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,770
[I told him]

408
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,360
[his mum didn't leave us.]

409
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,250
[Actually, his mum is a mermaid.]

410
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,690
[Now she is back in the sea.]

411
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,890
[When he grows up,]

412
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,790
she will come back to see him.

413
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,750
But lies

414
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,330
can't last forever.

415
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,740
Grandpa.

416
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,880
Don't say that.

417
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,880
It's not the case that he
doesn't believe in fairy tales.

418
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,480
He

419
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,440
just hasn't had time yet

420
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,340
to say goodbye to the one he used to be.

421
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,320
Yun Shu.

422
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,560
Do you know the reason

423
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,020
why

424
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,420
I asked you and Si Nian to get married?

425
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,190
Because I know

426
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:58,580
you're a kind and warm-hearted girl.

427
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,640
I believe you will have
an influence on Si Nian,

428
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,440
helping him to warm up to others.

429
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,580
Grandpa,

430
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,250
I promise you.

431
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,920
Does it fit?

432
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,420
Yes. Except that it's loose at the waist.

433
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,650
It's okay.

434
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,810
Make do for the night.

435
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,190
Today,

436
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,000
thank you for staying.

437
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,170
Grandpa is very happy.

438
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,860
No worries.

439
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,870
I happen to be off for a few days.

440
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,420
It's late.

441
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,440
Go to bed earlier.

442
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,840
We will go back

443
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,050
first thing tomorrow.

444
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,190
Mr Zhang,

445
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,540
are you asleep?

446
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,290
Not yet.

447
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,930
That day,

448
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,050
I didn't mean to enter your room
and rummage through your things.

449
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,670
You're not mad at me, are you?

450
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,730
No.

451
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,920
That day,

452
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,770
I overacted a little bit.

453
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,530
Grandpa told me everything.

454
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,430
What did he say to you?

455
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,160
The mermaid story.

456
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,420
It's already the past.

457
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,910
Fairy tales

458
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,620
are for coaxing kids.

459
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,230
In the real society,

460
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,150
they don't exist.

461
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,750
Mr Zhang,

462
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,420
can I say what I think?

463
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,540
Nevertheless,

464
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,350
all the emotions in it

465
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,820
are real.

466
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,220
So,

467
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,120
don't invalidate it.

468
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,650
Mr Zhang?

469
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,260
Yun Shu.

470
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,660
Actually, in private,

471
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,360
we don't have to deliberately
keep our distance.

472
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,160
What do you mean?

473
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,040
I mean

474
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,800
since you don't mind

475
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,160
and I don't mind

476
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,870
making our relationship known.

477
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,360
Go to sleep.

478
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,030
Goodnight.

479
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,340
Why are you here again?

480
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,010
It's too windy outside.

481
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,240
Just let me in.

482
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,430
What are you doing here?

483
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,260
I have a cold.

484
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,590
What a cold day!

485
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,030
What happened to your face?

486
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,180
Well, I'm allergic.

487
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,440
I can't eat seafood.

488
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,700
My friend insisted that
I eat seafood porridge.

489
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,000
That's the reason.

490
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,480
Here.

491
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,500
Ice bag.

492
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,420
Apply it yourself.

493
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,760
You have a fever?

494
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,370
No.

495
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,260
What are you doing?

496
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,890
I thought you you didn't
watch the TV series I starred in.

497
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,700
Here. Ginger tea.

498
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,250
Don't push it.

499
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:55,900
Umm...

500
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,020
Can I sleep here tonight?

501
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,190
I'm not feeling well. Take pity one me.

502
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,370
I'm all alone.

503
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,410
It's still so windy outside

504
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,860
and I still have a fever.

505
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,100
Please allow me to stay here.

506
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,170
I'll sleep on the sofa.

507
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,860
If you dare enter the room,

508
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,400
I'll kick you out.

509
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:13,650
Kick me to death.

510
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,500
I left a note next to the breakfast
on the table.

511
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,070
Let grandpa sleep a little longer.

512
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,270
Let's go first.

513
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,450
Where are you going?

514
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,660
I can drive you.

515
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,610
Mr Zhang,

516
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,650
do you have time later?

517
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,840
Yes.

518
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,400
I want you to accompany me to a place.

519
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,680
It's not far from here.

520
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,230
Okay.

521
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,830

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,590
I'll deal with something.

524
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,080
Wait for 15 minutes.

00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,620
Come to me in 15 minutes.

526
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,110

Okay.

00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,020
But wasn't that May 19?

569
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,190
That day,

570
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,810
did you guys agree
to go watch a movie

571
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,510
but you bought the wrong ticket

572
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:30,470
and slept overnight in one of the seats?

573
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,040
How did you know?

574
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,770
That day, the one who sat afar

575
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,800
was me.

576
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,660
That can't be true.

577
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,420
It was you?

578
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,260
So,

579
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,810
you were the one who

580
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,250
♫ You're a familiar stranger ♫

581
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,730
woke me up?

582
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,360
♫ Who keeps appearing before me ♫

583
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,620
Me?

584
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,860
I woke you up?

585
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,650
♫ You're clumsy yet kind ♫

586
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,660
Yes. Your crying woke me up.

587
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:59,160
♫ Ringing the bell in my heart ♫

588
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,880
It was sound from the movie.

589
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,560
That woke you up.

590
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,450
♫ You predict and plan ♫

591
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,280
♫ But you can't solve the problem
called love ♫

592
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,960
Mr Zhang.

593
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:07,910
♫ Let me tell you, just hold my hand ♫

594
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,590
It was a silent film.

595
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,160
♫ Looking up, I see
the most perfect you ♫

596
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,630
♫ Close your eyes and feel me out,
the plain girl ♫
