[Episode 12]

4
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,010
Mr Zhang, are we almost there?

5
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,500
Yes.

6
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,180
Today.

7
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,730
Thank you for taking a
detour to send me back.

8
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,660
When will you go to
work in the new company?

9
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,530
The day after tomorrow.

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,600
Well.

11
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,070
By the way,

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,850
I have a gift for you.

13
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:12,600
Yun Shu.

14
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,430
Can you move back in?

15
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,230
Yi Yi.

16
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,700
Do you think I should
move back in or not?

17
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,579
You know the answer.

18
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,279
What is that?

19
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,620
In order to fulfil the contract,

20
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,800
I tried my best to control

21
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,310
my feelings for Mr Zhang.

22
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,650
I'm afraid...

23
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,980
I'm afraid I'll

24
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,320
fall in love with him if I move back in.

25
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,530
What to do then?

26
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:40,300
I don't know what you're struggling with.

27
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,500
The experience of predecessors
since ancient times tells us that

28
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,730
it's better to make friends
than make enemies.

29
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,850
So Mr Zhang and you

30
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,040
can't leave each other.

31
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,050
What an enmity.

32
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,400
Why an enmity again?

33
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,400
Don't you know

34
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,540
only enmity makes us live together.

35
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,120
You don't have to struggle.

36
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,970
It's impossible for Mr Zhang and you

37
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,970
to fall apart.

38
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,380
What if my mind is messed up again

39
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,080
when I see him next time?

40
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,990
Then you just

41
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,730
recite ancient poems, formulas and words.

42
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,730
What do you mean?

43
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,280
The year I took the postgraduate
entrance examination,

44
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,710
in order to lay off gaming,

45
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,620
I came up with a very good method.

46
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,050
When I want to play games,

47
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,370
I recite English words.

48
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,110
From A to C.

49
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,420
Finally, I laid off gaming

50
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,780
and I got a 90 in my English exam.

51
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,270
So?

52
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,670
So when you're unconsciously
attracted to Mr Zhang,

53
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,980
you can try memorising

54
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,010
things that you can't usually memorise.

55
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,930
That way, you'll be distracted.

56
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,260
What I usually can't memorise?

57
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:37,450
That means

58
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,430
statistics formulas and concepts.

59
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,380
That's it, you can memorise formulas.

60
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,650
Yi Yi, the day after tomorrow
is my birthday.

61
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,530
Can you come to my birthday party?

62
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,500
Gu Xiao.

63
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,750
It's Gu Xiao.

64
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,680
He invited me to his birthday party.

65
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:57,830
Text him back quickly.

66
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,540
I hope you can come.

67
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,010
OK, I'll be there on time.

68
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,010
Sis, look, it's our new house.

69
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:06,240
♫ Turning off the lights
in search of its trace ♫

70
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,960
♫ I walk steadily
on the path beneath my feet ♫

71
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:18,630
♫ I hear someone asking,
are you still here? ♫

72
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:24,330
♫ The kind person replies,
I've always been here ♫

73
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,540
I'm Party B, right?

74
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:21,600
Separate the daily life...

75
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,570
Mr Zhang,

76
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,390
It's yours.

77
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,270
♫ This love cuts through the crowd
in search of me ♫

78
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,230
♫ It isn't easy ♫

79
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,150
♫ I only wish to cherish it with you ♫

80
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,280
♫ Each and every moment ♫

81
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:42,470
♫ If I missed out, I will meet you again
in another lifetime ♫

82
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:49,480
♫ I recognise your eyes,
a secret that belongs to me ♫

83
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,450
Mr Zhang,

84
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,480
I thought you would be back tonight.

85
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:18,110
♫ The night will pass,
I am the dawn ♫

86
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:24,110
♫ Protecting this innocence,
evident in your eyes ♫

87
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,830
I'm back.

88
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:30,460
♫ I hear someone asking,
do dreams come to an end? ♫

89
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,800
The house looks different.

90
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:36,360
♫ I will keep you company in
the future, never letting go ♫

91
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,070
You like to sleep in,

92
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,610
so I got blackout curtains for you.

93
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,190
♫ This love cuts through the crowd
in search of me ♫

94
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:41,700
Their colour is the same
as that of your clothes.

95
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:42,120
♫ It doesn't make sense ♫

96
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,130
♫ All I can do is silently
feel your breath ♫

97
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,429
It's beautiful.

98
00:06:46,429 --> 00:06:48,440
♫ And take you in my arms ♫

99
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:54,000
♫ If you care whether we'll still
be together in the next life ♫

100
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,480
You also changed the bed sheet.

101
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,860
The bed sheets and linens are new.

102
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,430
Do you like them?

103
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:00,560
♫ I want you to believe in my conviction ♫

104
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,850
The nightstand is also new.

105
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,120
♫ This love cuts through the crowd
in search of me ♫

106
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,050
You got no place to put your

107
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,880
underwear before.

108
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,230
♫ It isn't easy ♫

109
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,240
♫ I only wish to cherish it with you ♫

110
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,160
Thank you.

111
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,170
♫ Each and every moment ♫

112
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,380
♫ If I missed out, I will meet you again
in another lifetime ♫

113
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,780
Welcome home.

114
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:24,910
♫ I recognise your eyes,
a secret that belongs to me ♫

115
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,980
What are you doing?

116
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,000
Mr Zhang,

117
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,720
You're watching

118
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,530
stupid romantic drama?

119
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,840
By force.

120
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,610
Who dares to do that?

121
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,680
He calls me everyday

122
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,740
and lets me make
comments on his performance.

123
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,730
You said yes?

124
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,730
If I didn't say yes,

125
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,340
he would give me more calls

126
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,270
and force me to make more comments

127
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,830
on his performance.

128
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,610
So what do you think of his performance?

129
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,140
His performance

130
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,330
perfectly depicts a middle-aged man

131
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,330
with no dreams or goals.

132
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:22,980
And...

133
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,530
How should I put it?

134
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,530
Greasy.

135
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,010
Greasy.

136
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,130
It's a great word.

137
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,130
Accurate one.

138
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,010
Mr Zhang, you don't surf the Internet?

139
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,300
I usually go on math journal websites

140
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,410
to search for information.

141
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,130
Sometimes, I browse the
latest academic forums.

142
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,010
You don't

143
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,920
read news

144
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,250
or gossip?

145
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,230
I will read some substantive...

146
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,540
Gossip?

147
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,730
Why should I read them?

148
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,210
Because we want to

149
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,030
live a happy life.

150
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,050
I have math

151
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,350
so I'm living a happy life.

152
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,880
You like me, right?

153
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,400
No.

154
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,370
No.

155
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,680
I've seen this episode.

156
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,130
I remember that Lu Yu once told me that

157
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,030
actors easily fall
in love with each other

158
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,290
when filming those scenes.

159
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,450
Do you think

160
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,930
we'll have such wrong senses?

161
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,520
Mr Zhang,

162
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,670
I think this kind of drama is

163
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,200
not fit for you.

164
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,280
So you shouldn't watch them.

165
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,130
Good night.

166
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,000
What's going on?

167
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,460
Why did you call me here so urgently?

168
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,400
Something is wrong.

169
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,760
What is it?

170
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,500
Gu Xiao has a birthday party today.

171
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,400
Why are you still here?

172
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,120
I thought

173
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,050
Gu Xiao and I would
celebrate his birthday alone.

174
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,600
But I found that

175
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,260
many beauties were around him.

176
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,310
Look at me! I'm so casual.

177
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,530
Gao Zhi Yi.

178
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,230
You're always confident

179
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,770
in your appearance.

180
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,600
Oh, save it.

181
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,360
Stop kidding me.

182
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,970
You want to outshine

183
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,480
all women at present

184
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,600
in front of Gu Xiao?

185
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,170
Yeah

186
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,810
I'm naive indeed.

187
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,270
Alright. You can do everything.

188
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,600
Come on.

189
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,980
Figure something out.

190
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,230
I'm too embarrassed to get in there.

191
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,980
Do I look good?

192
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,070
It cost me three months of salary.

193
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,380
Of course it's beautiful.

194
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,580
I'll repay you.

195
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,230
Go.

196
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:27,920
Gu Xiao.

197
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:28,890
We can also get this.

198
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,570
Yi Yi.

199
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,180
You're late.

200
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,810
I've been waiting for you.

201
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,810
Happy birthday!

202
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,240
Thank you.

203
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,240
Yi Yi.

204
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,760
You look so great.

205
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,780
Gu Xiao.

206
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,730
Who's this girl?

207
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,210
My girlfriend.

208
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,900
Gorgeous.

209
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,540
Come on.

210
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,460
Follow me later.

211
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,130
Come on. Cheers.

212
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,080
Stop showing off.

213
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,400
How sweet.

214
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,830
How sweet.

215
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,130
Come on. Come on.

216
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,400
Come on. Join us.

217
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,200
Happy birthday. Happy birthday.

218
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,160
Thank you.

219
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:14,980
Happy birthday.

220
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:15,450
Light the candle.

221
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:15,920
Thank you.

222
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,380
Happy birthday to you!

223
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,310
♫ Happy Birthday to you ♫

224
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,530
Happy birthday to you!

225
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,390
♫ Happy Birthday to you ♫

226
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,450
Happy birthday!

227
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,120
Come on. Thanks.

228
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,130
Thank you all.

229
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,550
Thank you all for coming.

230
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,490
Come on.

231
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,650
Thanks.

232
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,530
Thank you all.

233
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:37,980
Thanks for coming.

234
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,610
Drink up.

235
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,200
Mine is expensive.

236
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,310
Why don't you have it?

237
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,440
No. No.

238
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,410
Just hear me out.

239
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,350
Attention please.

240
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,780
Listen to me.

241
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,080
Let me introduce

242
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,080
a new colleague to you.

243
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,730
Yun Shu.

244
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,280
Hello, everyone, I'm Yun Shu.

245
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,530
Nice to meet you.

246
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,920
From today on,

247
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,000
Yun Shu's going to be my new assistant.

248
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,370
You can communicate with her directly

249
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,010
about work schedules and arrangements.

250
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,120
Yun Shu.

251
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,790
This is your seat.

252
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,750
Come to me if you have any questions.

253
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,010
Thank you.

254
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,560
Liane,

255
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,370
show her around.

256
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,120
Okay.

257
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:22,850
Come with me, Yun Shu.

258
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:23,730
I'll show you around.

259
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:24,570
Okay.

260
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,320
I'm leaving now.

261
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,290
Go.

262
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:30,400
OK

263
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,810
Back to work.

264
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,780
Lawyer Meng always works alone.

265
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,250
Why did he hire an assistant?

266
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,000
If you have a crush on a girl,

267
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,780
young and beautiful.

268
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,730
You will also hire her.

269
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:45,980
No.

270
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,100
I think

271
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,630
you're way more beautiful.

272
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,150
Get out!

273
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,570
Come in.

274
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:07,940
Lawyer Meng,

275
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,079
I'm really grateful

276
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,650
that you hired me.

277
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,170
Though I'm not a law major

278
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,230
and I can't help you
with professional problems,

279
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,069
I'll try my best to study it

280
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,680
and I'll try

281
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,700
to give

282
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,670
you professional help

283
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:20,980
in a timely manner.

284
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,349
What's going on? Why so serious?

285
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,060
You seem to go to the battlefield.

286
00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:26,130
Take your time with your work.

287
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,579
You're my assistant

288
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,930
not my helper.

289
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:32,770
What's the matter?

290
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,740
Anything else?

291
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,650
Lawyer Meng,

292
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,950
I really want to learn.

293
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,440
I really want to help you.

294
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,430
You really want to learn?

295
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,180
OK, start with those three books.

296
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,270
Reference Book of National.

297
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,450
Judicial Examination of 2014.

298
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,560
What's the matter?

299
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,410
It's so many of them.

300
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,700
Alright. Lawyer Meng

301
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,520
I'll finish reading them.

302
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,660
Thank you.

303
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,140
They taste kind of spicy.

304
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,380
What are you looking at?

305
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,880
Yun Shu.

306
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,570
Yun Shu.

307
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,110
What are you looking at?

308
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,650
They're references given

309
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,210
by Lawyer Meng today.

310
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,590
Have dinner first.

311
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,670
I'm not hungry.

312
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,610
Lawyer Meng booked
fried chicken this afternoon.

313
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,180
I'm done.

314
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,150
Done?

315
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,450
I have some work to do.

316
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,180
You just place them here
when you finish your dinner.

317
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,750
I'll be back for them.

318
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,080
Hello, Wild Yu.

319
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,120
It's been a while!

320
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,780
How about having a drink tonight?

321
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,250
I'm busy. What's up?

322
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,230
Come on.

323
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:42,880
It's been a while since

324
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,250
you came to the bar last time.

325
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,330
And you didn't teach me

326
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,470
how to play that game.

327
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,530
Can you spare some time for it?

328
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,450
I'm busy.

329
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,400
I have to go.

330
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,850
Come on. Stay.

331
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,320
Come on.

332
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,440
Oh my god. For God's sake.
Just give me a break.

333
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,000
Nuts.

334
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,840
Listen to me.

335
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,980
I just...

336
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,280
Sickening.

337
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,560
Yun Shu.

338
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,870
Mr Zhang,

339
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,440
do you want to use pads?

340
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,880
Do you want to use the bathroom?

341
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,920
I'm here to tell you

342
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,770
I want to take a shower.

343
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,410
If you want to use the toilet,

344
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,050
then I'll be after you.

345
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,170
Never mind, Mr Zhang.

346
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,050
Thank you.

347
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,020
Okay.

348
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,310
Mr Zhang.

349
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,120
Go ahead.

350
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,530
Shut the door for me please.

351
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,040
Okay.

352
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,760
Why is she so hard-working now?

353
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:27,690
Yun Shu.

354
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,260
For me?

355
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,930
I want to drink milk just now.

356
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,180
So I warm one for you i passing.

357
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,130
Thanks, Mr Zhang.

358
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,220
You're welcome.

359
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,730
Anything else?

360
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,290
No.

361
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:51,960
Mr Zhang.

362
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,340
You're wearing the pyjamas I bought you.

363
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,420
Yeah.

364
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,930
Great.

365
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,580
It suits you well.

366
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,340
By the way,

367
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,730
can I help you with anything?

368
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,680
Well, these provisions are really hard

369
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,200
to understand.

370
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,200
I'm focusing hard

371
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,300
and reading word by word,

372
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,780
and I'm barely getting it.

373
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:16,970
So...

374
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,400
So?

375
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,680
So can you please turn that

376
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,970
TV down?

377
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,050
Otherwise I can't move on.

378
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,500
Of course.

379
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,110
By the way, Yun Shu.

380
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,800
You know I was a minor

381
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,180
in Law.

382
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,670
So I can help you

383
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,650
if you have any questions.

384
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,480
Don't bother.

385
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,350
Mr Meng said if I have
anything I can't understand,

386
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,120
I can circle them.

387
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,410
And he'll answer my
questions in the office.

388
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,490
Lawyer Meng.

389
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,330
The TV.

390
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,300
The TV?

391
00:20:58,810 --> 00:20:59,690
Okay.

392
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,680
I'll fight for it!

393
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,260
Lawyer Meng.

394
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,100
What's Yun Nan's story?

395
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,710
She became the director
within such a short time.

396
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,520
Maybe she and Mr Liu...

397
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,520
It makes sense.

398
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,020
Her eyes betray

399
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:36,980
that she's not a restless one.

400
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,250
Her charming eyes

401
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,030
can really get men enchanted.

402
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:44,600
[The spring breeze]

403
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,760
Why are you here?

404
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,170
Oh my gosh. Is this Lu Yu?

405
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,200
Come on. How could it be?

406
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,050
It's Lu Yu.

407
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,330
Yun Nan knows Lu Yu.

408
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,130
She's really unusual.

409
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,020
Awesome.

410
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,550
She gets the leader's support at work

411
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,150
and flowers from an idol off work.

412
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,120
Hold on.

413
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,930
Thanks for your praise.

414
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,980
I have it all.

415
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,060
I have a good face

416
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,550
and good ability to get promoted.

417
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,400
Why are you here?

418
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,830
I'm here to take you home.

419
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,200
Who's your girlfriend?

420
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:31,880
You are.

421
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,930
When did I say yes?

422
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,630
I've slept at your house twice.

423
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,600
No.

424
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,390
Three times.

425
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,260
You're definitely my girlfriend.

426
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,130
I'd like to make it clear.

427
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
If you feel bored,

428
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,230
I'm free now.

429
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,280
So we can kill time together.

430
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,930
If you want to get closer to me,

431
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,090
then sorry.

432
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,430
I have no such plans.

433
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,230
Yun Lan.

434
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,590
Take the flowers.

435
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,200
Kill the time.

436
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,720
Sis.

437
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,470
Thank you.

438
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,990
You're on time today.

439
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,980
I visited grandpa today.

440
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,020
Is he OK?

441
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,180
He's OK.

442
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,580
I've been busy recently.

443
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,720
When grandpa feels better,

444
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:30,700
I'll go to visit him.

445
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,020
Sis,

446
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,680
I have good news for you.

447
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,240
What is it?

448
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,560
I got a new job.

449
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,100
What kind of job?

450
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:41,820
In a law firm.

451
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,000
Like you.

452
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,160
But I'm just an assistant.

453
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,930
I can't believe there is a company

454
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,480
willing to take you.

455
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,400
Sis.

456
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,380
Listen,

457
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,780
do Zhang Si Nian and you

458
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,330
take effective contraception?

459
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,580
Don't get pregnant.

460
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,850
No. We didn't do that.

461
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,770
What?

462
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,730
No.

463
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,850
You got me wrong.

464
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,820
Yes.

465
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,370
No, sis.

466
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,720
What are you thinking?

467
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:14,850
I didn't sleep with him.

468
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,230
That's good.

469
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,940
Listen,

470
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,400
you're in a contractual relationship.

471
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,130
You'll part one year later.

472
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,210
Maybe you can have a different story end.

473
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,470
But don't sleep with him

474
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,080
unless you

475
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,450
crazily love each other.

476
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,480
Got it?

477
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,400
Yes.

478
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,400
Yes.

479
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,640
Sis.

480
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,140
Did you ever crazily love someone?

481
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,440
Not even when you were abroad?

482
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,230
I was busy with work every day.

483
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,000
So I never cared about that.

484
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,330
You had a hard time.

485
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,780
You look not smart.

486
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,800
But you did well.

487
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,810
You have to thank me.

488
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,780
I feel your thanks.

489
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:11,470
You're welcome.

490
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,440
But...

491
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:13,650
She is new here,

492
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,430
yet you assigned so many tasks for her.

493
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,890
You are exploiting a worker.

494
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,930
Exploiting a worker?

495
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,990
Zhang Si Nian.

496
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,970
When did you start to use

497
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,680
such an inappropriate word?

498
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,210
You know what I mean.

499
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,210
You let me

500
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,580
give Yun Shu a job.

501
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,100
You let me help her.

502
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,050
This is the beginning.

503
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,190
You overprotect her.

504
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,540
What should I do then?

505
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,180
I mean you shouldn't

506
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,810
influence our normal life.

507
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,870
You're in a contractual relationship.

508
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,830
It's not normal.

509
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,370
Yun Shu, you want to see Lawyer Meng?

510
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,180
Yeah.

511
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,020
I've finished all the
tasks he's given to me.

512
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,810
I'll take them to his office.

513
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,270
No way.

514
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,050
You'd better come up with a

515
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,530
reasonable cause to explain
why you are in my office.

516
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:02,330
Five, four, three.

517
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,270
Yun Shu.

518
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,410
This is the task you assigned to me.

519
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,860
I've reviewed the document.

520
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,180
Nice job.

521
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,050
Thank you.

522
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,200
Is there anything else I should do?

523
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,580
Nothing special.

524
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:19,770
Well, I'm off now.

525
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:21,770
Yun Shu.

526
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,630
You're the newcomer.

527
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,970
And I want to ask you

528
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,370
if you're under too much pressure

529
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,450
because of those tasks I assigned to you.

530
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,440
Of course not.

531
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,080
A slow sparrow should make an early start.

532
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,720
I'm starting from zero,

533
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,410
so I have to try harder.

534
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,010
Well,

535
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,610
will your life be influenced?

536
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,200
Of course not.

537
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,120
Actually, I don't have my own life.

538
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,530
Work is my life now.

539
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,160
Work is not only life.

540
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,180
Life shouldn't only be about work.

541
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:52,270
You have to learn to release your
work-related stress.

542
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,330
Lawyer Meng.

543
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,430
Sorry, maybe I'm a bit slow.

544
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,950
So I didn't fully understand your words.

545
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,710
But I'll try harder.

546
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,170
You're way smarter than someone.

547
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,210
At least,

548
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,180
you know what life is.

549
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:08,830
What's the matter?

550
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,790
It's okay.

551
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,600
I got a cramp.

552
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,570
I got a cramp.

553
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,520
Go.

554
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,610
Well, I'm off now.

555
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,980
Yun Shu.

556
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,610
Yun Shu.

557
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,140
What's the matter?

558
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,490
You...

559
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,020
You don't have to read your documents?

560
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:42,950
No.

561
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,830
Lawyer Meng gave me a day off.

562
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,090
He said happiness
matters most in our life.

563
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,330
Are you unhappy at the law firm?

564
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,330
I'm happy.

565
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,150
Since I went to work at the law office,

566
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,120
I feel that my life has
become more meaningful.

567
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,100
I'm really happy.

568
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,700
That's good.

569
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,110
Yun Shu.

570
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,550
Yun Shu.

571
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,970
Your work is tiring.

572
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,200
You don't have to

573
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:19,900
do those chores at home.

574
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,400
Why don't I get you a cleaning lady?

575
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,070
Don't bother. I can handle these.

576
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,200
Also, I can feel more relaxed

577
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,960
when I'm doing chores.

578
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,970
Doing chores makes

579
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,890
you happy?

580
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,820
Yeah.

581
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,180
It's my life.

582
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,680
Okay.

583
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:34,650
Mr Zhang,

584
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,180
what are some things
in your life

585
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,330
that makes you happy?

586
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,280
Math and work

587
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,060
I've told you that before.

588
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,600
I feel like...

589
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,120
Maybe you can try

590
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,330
doing something trivial.

591
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,530
Maybe they can make you feel far happier.

592
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,030
Alright. I'm going to

593
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,440
go to the supermarket.

594
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,170
Yun Shu.

595
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:02,630
Why not go together?

596
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,960
OK

597
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,540
What are you thinking about?

598
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,120
The supermarket offers discounts today.

599
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,280
I'm trying to figure how

600
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,550
I can buy those goods
at the lowest price.

601
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,130
Let me calculate.

602
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,500
10 percent off...

603
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,680
20 percent off...

604
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,810
Let me help you.

605
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,050
OK.

606
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:11,640
[Redeem points]

607
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:15,690
[Single-item discount]

608
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,370
[Spend 1000 yuan and get 299 yuan]

609
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,980
OK. I'm done.

610
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,990
Chap,

611
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,200
be honest.

612
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,250
Tell me

613
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,250
how I can buy them economically?

614
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:41,280
Right.

615
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,050
Just give us an example.

616
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,040
Am I right, girl?

617
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,030
You can buy goods worth 188 yuan.

618
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,520
And then

619
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,070
pay them

620
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,440
by using the coupon worth 25 yuan.

621
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,250
With 1000 points in your membership card,

622
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,660
you can get 10 yuan off.

623
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,050
Then you can get a red pocket worth 5 yuan

624
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,320
through WeChat Pay.

625
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,080
Then you can use these red pockets

626
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,870
when you shop next time.

627
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,510
It's the most economical way, I guess.

628
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,940
So.

629
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,239
Let's go.

630
00:32:17,739 --> 00:32:18,810
Well,

631
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,850
you're similar to that lady.

632
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,360
Chap.

633
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,739
It's you.

634
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,670
Chap,

635
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,730
your way is really helpful.

636
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,440
Look.

637
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:43,130
We bought a bunch of stuff

638
00:32:43,219 --> 00:32:44,560
and we got a lot of discounts.

639
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,449
You're a fine-looking

640
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,600
and economically rational person.

641
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,449
Chap, what do you do?

642
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,210
I...

643
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,000
He's a mathematics researcher.

644
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,350
Yes.

645
00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:56,380
You must be a math
teacher in a middle school.

646
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,600
No wonder he's so brilliant.

647
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:01,570
Your girlfriend is beautiful

648
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,770
and able to keep house.

649
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,170
You're really lucky.

650
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,140
That's it.

651
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,440
She's not my girlfriend.

652
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,800
We're a married couple.

653
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,730
A married couple!

654
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:17,680
You're meant to be together.

655
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:18,400
Good for you.

656
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,250
It's our turn to pay. Come on.

657
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:19,980
OK.

658
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,000
Thanks, chap.

659
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,120
Thank you.

660
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,160

indeed bring happiness to us.

670
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,760
