[Episode 13]

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,490
[Mr Zhang,
I have to work overtime tonight.]

5
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:28,750
[I'll return home late.]

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,310
[Okay.]

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,579
Professor Wu.

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,000
-Have you seen the news alert?
-No.

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,590
It says there will be a
massive drop in temperature tonight.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,640
Really?

11
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,290
No wonder it's so cold.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,170
I will go off work now.

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,300
Put on more clothes.

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,350
I'm off.

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,320
See you tomorrow.

16
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:50,690
Hey.

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,230
Please don't trouble me any more.

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,829
That's the warden's job.

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,120
You should cherish the chance.

20
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,210
In future, my dear Gu
will handle these things.

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,579
I really can't figure it out.

22
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,670
Why you girls

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,840
cover the flush with so much effort

24
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,260
then draw it on your face?

25
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,360
Well.

26
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,270
Pluck your eyebrows, then draw them.

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,400
Why?

28
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,290
You don't need to know it.

29
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,320
As long as my dear Gu knows it.

30
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,760
Dear Gu!

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,760
By the way.

32
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:14,930
That barrel water.

33
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,180
Change it for me, Ok?

34
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,330
Thanks.

35
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,690
Gao Zhiyi, I tell you

36
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,980
I will charge you if you
ask me to do it any more.

37
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,320
Be satisfied.

38
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,490
Next time?

39
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,990
You won't have another chance.

40
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:25,720
Such matters will all be done

41
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,160
by dear Gu

42
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,500
I mean, be careful tonight.

43
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,940
Gu Xiao doesn't look like

44
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,800
a gentleman.

45
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,270
You are just jealous of me

46
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,540
I am serious about it.

47
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,120
Do you still remember the day of birthday?

48
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,350
Girls who go there are really charming.

49
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,970
Nothing happens for no reason.

50
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,820
So, Gu Xiao cannot be a gentleman.

51
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,480
Are you

52
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,579
jealous?

53
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,120
I am just worried about you.

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,570
Shall I go with you tonight?

55
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,240
Nope! Urgh.

56
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:52,880
No one would take her ex to date

57
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,520
I am for your good!

58
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,730
If you feel happy.

59
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,180
You may lose your money and dignity!

60
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,910
I cherish my dignity, OK?

61
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,220
You!

62
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,990
Fine, Gao Zhiyi.

63
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,800
How dare you to do this to your ex!

64
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,230
I mean, If I am a little slower,

65
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,830
I would be disfigured.

66
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,730
Lawyer Meng.

67
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,060
What are you reading?

68
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,110
Nothing.

69
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,170
A comic book.

70
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:21,839
What's the matter?

71
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:22,870
Cartoons.

72
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,519
What's it about?

73
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,200
-He does not have any friends-

74
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,600
Is the author of this cartoon.

75
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,060
Jun Sakura.

76
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,150
He has been drawing this

77
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,390
for seven years.

78
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,300
Good for you, Yun Shu.

79
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,070
It's not so popular in China.

80
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,820
I never imagined that you are

81
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,140
also a fan like me

82
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,870
I don't care whether
he has friends or not.

83
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,750
But today, I have a new friend.

84
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,720
Me too

85
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,080
I finally have a friend

86
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,750
who also loves this cartoon.

87
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,020
I don't quite agree

88
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,550
I didn't say that.

89
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,480
He is so cold

90
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,159
and impersonal.

91
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,270
Maybe he's good in a cartoon.

92
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,520
But he's too mean in reality.

93
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,580
But in real life, I have

94
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,810
a friend just like him.

95
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,500
Me too!

96
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,720
Really?

97
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,910
Such a coincidence！.

98
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,180
Tell me.

99
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,790
How do you know

100
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,220
him?

101
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,510
Well.

102
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,510
That's a long story.

103
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,270
The subscriber you dialed is power off.

104
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,290
So.

105
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,510
Thanks to him

106
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,200
I didn't lose too much

107
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,150
because of my cousin.

108
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,620
Also because of him

109
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,520
I can make it so far.

110
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,659
And doing quite well.

111
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,520
Then what's the relationship

112
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,190
between you two？.

113
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,710
Relationship?

114
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,800
Friends, maybe.

115
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,340
Just friends?

116
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,830
Didn't you go further?

117
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,760
No

118
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,510
I think you have fallen in love

119
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,970
with him.

120
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,280
No！.

121
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,710
Don't you know

122
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,710
about his character.

123
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,160
How dare I!

124
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,000
[Zhang Si Nian]

125
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,280
Lawyer Meng.

126
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,950
How did you get to know Mr Zhang?

127
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,650
So, it's not a coincidence for
you to come to the supermarket.

128
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,470
It's Mr Zhang who told you.

129
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,730
It's Zhang Si Nian who
recommended you to me.

130
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,490
Then I went to the
supermarket and got to know you.

131
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,200
Finally you went to the law office.

132
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,390
But I want to tell you, Yun Shu.

133
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,510
After you had this job,

134
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,840
you really surprise me

135
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,400
with your performance and efforts.

136
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,720
For me, it's a huge surprise.

137
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,680
You have come up to this job

138
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:17,560
entirely with your own efforts.

139
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,030
We.

140
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,310
All want to help you.

141
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,820
So please don't mind about

142
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,900
how you get this job.

143
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,350
Don't worry.

144
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,870
No matter how I get this job,

145
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,940
I will do my best to complete it.

146
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,440
Hello, sir.

147
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,409
May I ask...

148
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,030
Sorry

149
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,680
I am looking for someone.

150
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,750
OK, excuse me.

151
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,720
Thanks.

152
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,620
Why are you drinking here?

153
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,060
Gao Zhiyi, please be mature.

154
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:38,080
Gu Xiao is not a

155
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:39,700
gentleman at all.

156
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,800
[Gu Xiao]

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,880
Hello.

158
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,070
Lin Nuo.

159
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,150
Why are you here?

160
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,230
Well.

161
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:09,640
I...

162
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,950
Why am I here?

163
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,510
Yiyi has drank too much.

164
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,270
It's too late now.

165
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,800
She cannot go back to her dormitory.

166
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,030
So I booked a room, and let her rest here.

167
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,310
I call you

168
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,880
to ask you to come
here and look after her.

169
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,980
After all, it isn't suitable
for me to be here.

170
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,720
Then, please take care of her

171
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,690
I gotta go.

172
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,260
Go to play basketball?

173
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:46,980
Yiyi.

174
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,080
Are you OK?

175
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,680
Lin Nuo.

176
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,620
What's the matter?

177
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,070
Come on, you are not drunk at all.

178
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,460
Of course I am not.

179
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,440
Don't you know about how much I can drink?

180
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,110
I have seen you downstairs.

181
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,150
Why are you here?

182
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:01,960
No

183
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,630
I am worried about you

184
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,660
I saw Gu Xiao making
you drink all the time.

185
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:07,800
I had a hard time

186
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,480
to find a pleasing boyfriend.

187
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,080
May you please stop
the surveillance on me?

188
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,570
It's not surveillance

189
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,270
I am

190
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,420
afraid that he doesn't
show respect to you.

191
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,270
Please

192
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,390
I am voluntary, OK?!

193
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,230
You have seen it.

194
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,440
He is a gentleman.

195
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,150
Why are you thinking him so bad?

196
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,360
No,

197
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,910
I am not!

198
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,160
I...

199
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:27,810
I mean.

200
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,420
Do you still like me?

201
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,800
Not at all!

202
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,350
Well.

203
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,310
You are my ex, not my dad

204
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,300
I am an adult now.

205
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,090
Even if I was cheated and tricked by him,

206
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,610
I am willing to.

207
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,580
Ok.

208
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,770
Whatever.

209
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,960
I didn't expect that we both like it.

210
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,240
So you have only read

211
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,350
it for a time.

212
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,390
And I got you?

213
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,360
Yeah.

214
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,570
Yun Shu.

215
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,550
Put my clothes on.

216
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,520
It's alright

217
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,320
I am not cold.

218
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,730
You will catch a cold.

219
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,720
No, thanks

220
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,640
I am not cold

221
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,610
I don't need it.

222
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,700
Why are you here?

223
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,220
Come here.

224
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,270
You came to pick me up？.

225
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,850
Yeah.

226
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,180
Mr Zhang is so considerate.

227
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,040
I have to keep my own things well.

228
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,830
Let's go home.

229
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,590
Hold on, Mr Zhang.

230
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,520
Tonight

231
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,520
I was going to have dinner

232
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,780
with Yun Shu.

233
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,560
Do you want to come together?

234
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,120
Really?

235
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,490
Yes.

236
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,080
OK

237
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,620
Just order what you like.

238
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,150
So delicious!

239
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,520
What do you want?

240
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,840
What's the smell?

241
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:28,760
Is it not so clean?

242
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,170
Shall we change a restaurant?

243
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,430
Smell?

244
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,330
Mr Zhang

245
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,260
I bet you haven't tasted Luosifen.

246
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,280
I am ordering.

247
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,830
A bowl of Luosifen with pig's intestines.

248
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,530
A quail egg.

249
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,200
Sour bamboo shoot, meat of snail

250
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,520
and Fried Toufu.

251
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,880
Good for you, Yun Shu.

252
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:47,930
Good taste.

253
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,630
You know Super Luosifen.

254
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,580
This is not the super one.

255
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,520
For it lacks.

256
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,150
Fried Beancurd Sticks.

257
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,040
Stop showing off.

258
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,010
Come on.

259
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,230
I want the same one with Yun Shu's.

260
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:08,970
Don't you order, Mr Zhang?

261
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,870
I can share with Yun Shu.

262
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,080
OK?

263
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,010
It's not sanitary to share a bowl.

264
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,190
Let's separate the food

265
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,350
I'll go to order.

266
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,430
She already knows it.

267
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,570
When you called me,

268
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,260
she was just aside.

269
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,230
She saw everything.

270
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,760
Then.

271
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,180
She said that she doesn't care

272
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,450
how she got this job

273
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,160
and that she will treasure it.

274
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,450
Zhang Si Nian.

275
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,960
You have a good taste.

276
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,160
Yun Shu is a good girl.

277
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,590
That's none of your business.

278
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,190
Yun Shu is my wife.

279
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,030
Contracted wife!

280
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,210
To be specific,

281
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,240
according to the contract,

282
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,370
you are at most

283
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,350
roommates.

284
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,040
What's your position?

285
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,420
What are you talking about?

286
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,380
Something happy?

287
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,750
Yes.

288
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,950
That's right.

289
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,550
Mr Zhang.

290
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,950
So, thank you.

291
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,600
Just deliver you clothes.

292
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,130
Never mind.

293
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:26,640
No

294
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,910
I mean the job.

295
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,190
Thanks for recommending me

296
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,260
this job

297
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,830
I just said it casually.

298
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,370
It's your own efforts to work

299
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,360
in the law office

300
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:40,990
I will try hard

301
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,630
and learn from Lawyer Meng

302
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,290
I will

303
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,840
live up to your expectation.

304
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,370
Mr Zhang.

305
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,340
Are you OK?

306
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,880
Aren't you having a cold?

307
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:50,890
Of course not

308
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,550
This kind of temperature

309
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,750
doesn't pose a threat to me.

310
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,260
Please come in.

311
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,090
Mr Zhang

312
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,110
I think you have a little cold.

313
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,580
No, I don't have a cold.

314
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,090
It's the best if you are fine

315
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,640
I have cooked ginger decoction for you.

316
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,680
It's good for both curing and prevention.

317
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,810
You can have a try

318
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,760
I'm OK.

319
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,720
Thank you.

320
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,240
And I doubt

321
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,360
it will prevent or

322
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,410
cure colds

323
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,610
deeply.

324
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,190
Such folk prescription

325
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,150
is not reliable

326
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,830
in terms of the evidence gathering

327
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,000
and resulting.

328
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:55,570
OK

329
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,800
If you don't want, I will take it away.

330
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:57,770
Wait.

331
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,980
Don't you refuse to drink?

332
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,100
I will prove it unreliable

333
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,230
myself.

334
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,320
Hot.

335
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,460
Why are you in such a hurry?

336
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,390
Let me cool it off.

337
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,690
Now better.

338
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,260
Is it?

339
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,960
Quite delicious?

340
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,640
Ok.

341
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,990
Let's go.

342
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,050
Yu.

343
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,630
What are you busy for these days?

344
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,900
You haven't been out
with us for a long time.

345
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,000
Tonight we have a party.

346
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,010
Full of beauties.

347
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,720
Will you hang out with us tonight?

348
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,400
No, thanks

349
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,810
I have something to do tonight.

350
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,710
What is more important than drinking?

351
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,680
Bingbing.

352
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,300
Do you have a dream?

353
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:09,310
Don't you think we should
practice out acting skills

354
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,250
for the future of China's movie industry?

355
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:12,810
Yu

356
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,250
I found that

357
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:14,859
I cannot keep up with you.

358
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,130
Please go on your practice

359
00:15:16,369 --> 00:15:17,940
I will go drinking.

360
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,569
It's such a long way.

361
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,230
It seems only Yun Lan
can accompany with me.

362
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:29,000
I think our friendship comes to an end

363
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:29,970
tonight.
364
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:26,990
Then we should think about our love.

364
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,460
Then we should think about our love.

365
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,310
Knock it off!

366
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,740
There must be something wrong
with my opening.

367
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,360
What?

368
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,720
The TV drama that Zhao wants you to act

369
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,690
has forty episodes.

370
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,950
Forty?

371
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,320
That's too long.

372
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:53,730
Alright

373
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,060
I also think the law
topic isn't suitable for you.

374
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:57,770
Hold on.

375
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,460
Law?

376
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,280
Yeah.

377
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,080
Law?

378
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,270
You will act a lawyer.

379
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,580
Lawyer?

380
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,960
Law!

381
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,090
Mr Zhang.

382
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,560
If you are not feeling
well, just get more sleep.

383
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,100
Today I will go to work by metro.

384
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,670
The ginger decoction really works.

385
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,860
Yun Shu.

386
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,390
Lawyer Meng.

387
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,360
You came for me?

388
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,610
Liane

389
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,610
I'm going to sign you up for a class.

390
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,360
The company will pay for it.

391
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,190
OK

392
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,320
What is it about?

393
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,750
Economics or Criminal Law?

394
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,940
Emotion Management.

395
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,520
Emotion Management?

396
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,430
I mean, you are skilled
at divorce lawsuits.

397
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,400
There's no doubt on your professionalism.

398
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,350
Why did you show your

399
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,560
personal emotions

400
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,430
to the client?

401
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,870
It's Gao Mei's lawsuit.

402
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,450
How many lawsuits do we have with Gao Mei.

403
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,560
Don't you know?

404
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,660
For this time, Gao Mei has done too much.

405
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,160
It's her who should go to
learn emotion management.

406
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,440
There is only one person allowed.

407
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,630
Either you go

408
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,160
or you persuade her to go.

409
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,000
I see.

410
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,300
After this, don't make any fightback

411
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,600
I will make her satisfied.

412
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,870
Gao Mei will be here after a while.

413
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,460
Do I need to buy you an insurance?

414
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,420
No, thanks.

415
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,250
Are you my lawyer, or his?

416
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,520
He has an affair with other
woman, and transferred his property.

417
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,020
He wants me to afford half of his debts.

418
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,550
Why are you telling
me to make up with him?

419
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,480
Miss Gao.

420
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,260
Please calm.

421
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,100
Calm?

422
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:44,970
How can I be calm?

423
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,510
Why should I be calm?

424
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,390
How can you solve the
problem without being calm?

425
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,480
Mei.

426
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,080
I made this coffee for you myself.

427
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,040
Have a taste.

428
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:00,320
Liane.

429
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,710
What's going on?

430
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,610
Yun Shu.

431
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,460
Miss Gao

432
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,030
wants a divorce in three months.

433
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,560
But our evidence now

434
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,160
isn't enough to prove his
ex-husband transfer property.

435
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,420
So the plan provided is

436
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,100
propose an out-of-court settlement.

437
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,210
Do I have to pay so much to you

438
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,390
if I want an out-of-court settlement?

439
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,880
Did you make any deal

440
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,930
with the lawyers of my

441
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,000
ex-husband?

442
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,360
That's why you want me this?

443
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,690
Miss Gao.

444
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,720
You can question my ability.

445
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:33,290
But please don't

446
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,160
insult me on my professional ethics.

447
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,520
Mei.

448
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,490
Well.

449
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,030
Liane just made reasonable plans

450
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,650
according to the present evidence

451
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,610
to satisfy your needs as much as we can.

452
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,630
Well.

453
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,600
Don't worry.

454
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,510
If you are unsatisfied,

455
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,020
we can make further adjustments.

456
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,560
How can I calm down.

457
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,560
Every day, I am harassed by

458
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,960
banks and guarantee companies.

459
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,150
The account of my own company

460
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,630
faces the risk to be froze any time.

461
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,840
How can I calm down?

462
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,190
It nearly drives me mad!

463
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,710
What's the use of worrying?

464
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,970
It's all because of

465
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,390
your incompetence.

466
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:04,240
Mei.

467
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,390
Don't get angry.

468
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,450
Yun Shu.

469
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,030
Are you OK, Yun Shu?

470
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,090
Sorry!

471
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,270
I don't mean it.

472
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,730
Let's take her to the hospital.

473
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,440
No, I am fine.

474
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,270
In fact...

475
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,230
Mei.

476
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,990
As a lawyer, I suggest you.

477
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,400
No one can plan your life

478
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,690
as you wish.

479
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,560
As a man

480
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,760
I suggest you

481
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,240
there is no man in this world

482
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,470
loves women of bad temper.

483
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,720
If you have vigor.

484
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,690
Go to collect the evidence

485
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,720
of your husband's affairs.

486
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:33,120
Or you can accept our suggestion of
settle out of court as soon as possible.

487
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,040
Yun Shu.

488
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:34,830
Endure it

489
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,150
I will take you to hospital.

490
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,850
[Emergency]

491
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,490
I'm sorry. Sorry

492
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,790
I was so angry just now

493
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,590
I didn't expect it to be so bad.

494
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,480
Lawyer Meng.

495
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,080
Sorry.

496
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,470
It's not me who injured.

497
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,510
It's alright.

498
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,610
The doctor has said

499
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,000
it's just a scald.

500
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,160
It will be better after a few days.

501
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,120
Yun Shu.

502
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,590
Being kind is not advantages.

503
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,730
Lawyer Meng.

504
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,260
Mei doesn't really mean it.

505
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,090
This accident happened in the company

506
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,040
I have the obligation
to deal with it for you.

507
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,230
You have to believe me

508
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,990
I can deal with it myself.

509
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,750
Yun Shu.

510
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,310
Any compensation scheme

511
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,470
I will promise it.

512
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,030
I don't know what's going on

513
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,000
I cannot control myself at all.

514
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,780
All of a sudden.

515
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,780
You are just too over burden these days.

516
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,710
The divorce

517
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,030
really mess me up

518
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,640
I can neither do well in my company

519
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,840
nor get along with my child.

520
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,630
Maybe I am really

521
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,270
an unqualified woman.

522
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:38,960
Mei.

523
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,500
Don't say that

524
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,580
I don't think so.

525
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,550
We all prefer to deal with
problems with our emotions.

526
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,410
But if so, it will only be worse.

527
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,070
Sometimes, we need to change an approach.

528
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,380
The answer will come out itself.

529
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:55,530
Yun Shu.

530
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:56,630
So, thank you.

531
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,460
This is the most sincere

532
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,400
advise that I have heard for half a year.

533
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,720
May I ask who will

534
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:02,960
pay the bill?

535
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:03,930
The bill comes out

536
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:04,920
I will go.

537
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:05,990
Just have a rest.

538
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:07,800
Come here.

539
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:08,780
Follow me.

540
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,170
You just shouldn't

541
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,270
forgive her so easily.

542
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,230
People only grow in education.

543
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,300
I don't want to punish a mother

544
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,110
because of

545
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,820
these matters

546
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,140
I don't want to.

547
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,780
You impress me indeed.

548
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:31,840
Are you hungry?

549
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,120
You haven't eaten for such a long time

550
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,360
I will buy you something good to eat.

551
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,720
Thanks.

552
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:36,690
By the way.

553
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,470
You just said that

554
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,360
dealing with emotions

555
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,610
doesn't help it

556
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:42,880
at all.

557
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,480
That's sounds quite familiar.

558
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,820
It's said by Mr Zhang.

559
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,570
Why are you here?

560
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,070
How did Yun Shu injure?

561
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,410
Empyrosis

562
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,910
made by a client accidentally.

563
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,400
What did the doctor say?

564
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,480
Nothing serious.

565
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,280
Don't touch water.

566
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,690
Have a good rest.

567
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:10,630
Where were you then?

568
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,600
Just there.

569
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,820
Thanks so much.

570
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:16,610
Yun Shu.

571
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,280
Lawyer Meng.

572
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,250
Where is Mei?

573
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,750
She just left

574
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,180
Mr Zhang.

575
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:24,850
Does it hurt?

576
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:25,680
No, it's OK.

577
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,240
Doctor says it's not serious.

578
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,400
It will be better after a few days

579
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,830
I have told you before.

580
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,350
The company is complicated and dangerous.

581
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,940
Do be more careful.

582
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,500
Why are you so careless?

583
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,030
Complicated and dangerous?

584
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,520
This is a law office.

585
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,670
Not the wolf den.

586
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,940
Nothing dangerous, OK?!

587
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,000
Then please explain

588
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,270
why Yun Shu got bodily injury?

589
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,330
Mr Zhang, you are
using wrong words again.

590
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,210
Bodily injury

591
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,160
means damaging the
completeness of human body

592
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,510
or destroying the main
functions of human organs.

593
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,240
Yun Shu got a scald.

594
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,520
Then you think.

595
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:58,310
Yun Shu didn't get harm heavily enough?

596
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,400
Please don't mistake my meaning

597
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,330
I am just correcting your misuse of words.

598
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,830
Yun Shu.

599
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,690
Newly fried.

600
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,660
Have a taste.

601
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,780
Wait.

602
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,390
Oil fried food is not
good for the healing.

603
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,440
Yun Shu

604
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,450
I will take you home.

605
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,270
That's okay.

606
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:15,920
You haven't eaten for a day.

607
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,140
Have some.

608
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:18,470
Don't take it.

609
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,440
Let me feed you.

610
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,340
Did you wash your hands?

611
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,460
Of course yes.

612
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,820
You... I...

613
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,840
No...

614
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,820
Stop it! Both of you.

615
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,350
I will not eat.

616
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,000
Come on, Yun Shu.

617
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,810
OK. I will do it myself.

618
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,780
Thanks. Lawyer Meng.

619
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,760
Who is the relative of Yun Shu?

620
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,070
Take the wheelchair here.

621
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,290
I...

622
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,500
I am her boss.

623
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,460
I am her husband.

624
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,300
Yun Lan

625
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,150
I want to introduce a friend to you.

626
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,030
Lawyer Yun.

627
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,420
You seem quite different in saying hello.

628
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,450
So.

629
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,580
You know each other?

630
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,550
Be my assistant.

631
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,000
Mr Lu

632
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,260
is going to act in a law TV series.

633
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,260
We have the honor to cooperate with him.

634
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,230
What do you mean?

635
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,280
In the future three months,

636
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,200
he will experience the life here

637
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,280
being your assistant.

638
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,480
Why me?

639
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,500
Of course.

640
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,430
You are the trump card.

641
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,260
Trump card?!

642
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,700
Mr Liu, you know.

643
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,870
I have the cooperation with Xinda.

644
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,370
How can I spare time to train

645
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,120
newcomers?

646
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,080
See.

647
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,000
Don't shrink from difficulties

648
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,020
Mr Lu is so famous now.

649
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,680
This will achieve

650
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,170
better promotion effect.

651
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,870
Don't refuse.

652
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,240
Lawyer Yun

653
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,840
I would appreciate your advice.

654
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:33,880
Since you are a trainee,

655
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,090
I think

656
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,350
you should start from the very basic

657
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,710
send all papers of enterprise cooperation

658
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,990
in the two previous years

659
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,190
to my office.

660
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,360
So firstly,

661
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,650
I want to invite you

662
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,040
to my home to make a good teaching

663
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,640
of what's about law.

664
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,440
Please come in.

665
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:50,910
Lan.

666
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,110
This is the materials you need.

667
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,080
Put them there.

668
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,450
Thanks.

669
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,120
Lawyer Yun.

670
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,720
Please have some rest while working hard.

671
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:00,600
So much work.

672
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,630
When can you finish it?

673
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,830
Not mine.

674
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,450
Yours.

675
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,350
Don't you say you want to start from zero.

676
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,150
Read all cases in a weak

677
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,040
and make two conclusions of each case.

678
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,440
Handle them to me

679
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,460
on Monday.

680
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:16,880
Today is Friday, sis!

681
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,080
You have seven days a week.

682
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,840
Don't you have holiday in law office?

683
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,040
I don't know

684
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,230
I never have one.

685
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,600
Mr Lu, if you think this is too hard.

686
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,400
You cannot handle.

687
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,280
You can tell Director Liu
to change someone for you.

688
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,400
Lawyer Gao Nan over there.

689
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:30,930
She...

690
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,900
Don't...

691
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,970
I just love this kind of

692
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,920
busy and full life.

693
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:35,940
Monday is OK.

694
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,830
Read them out of the room.

695
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,610
Your schedule plan

696
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,200
has something to change.

697
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:00,990
When I arrive home,

698
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,600
I will send you after finishing.

699
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,030
And the Year Meeting...

700
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,840
Yun Shu.

701
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,280
Don't worry about your work any more.

702
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,240
Have a good rest at home.

703
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,870
Read more comics.

704
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,920
There are new updates.

705
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,300
I will read them the moment I arrive home.

706
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,380
You said you will work just now!

707
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,490
Well, Mr Meng

708
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,950
I have a request.

709
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,800
Go ahead.

710
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,250
Can you continue on.

711
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:25,040
Gao Mei's cases on your own?

712
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,670
She is living hard recently.

713
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,780
So

714
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,430
I will say yes to any your request.

715
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,510
Be careful of your hands.

716
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,530
Liane.

717
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,460
Make Yun Shu a full worker.

718
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,020
Add an accident injury insurance.

719
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:55,880
In addition.

720
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,720
Update companies' security system.

721
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,710
Add a camera in every meeting room.

722
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,850
Who is Gao Mei.

723
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,430
The client who scalded me.

724
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,000
So I guess I was right.

725
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,610
Did I do something wrong?

726
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,290
No.

727
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:32,980
You are yourself.

728
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:34,790
As long as you're happy.

729
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,150
By the way.

730
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,460
What's the name of uploaded comics?

731
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,660
-He does not have any friends-

732
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,540
The one said by Lawyer Meng?

733
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,110
You are finally awake.

734
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,090
What time is it?

735
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,000
Mr Lu, you slept like a log.

736
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:33,820
You slept like a log.

737
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:34,640
From 3:00 p.m.

738
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,630
to 9:30 p.m.

739
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,110
You didn't wake up one time.

740
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,170
For many times

741
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,850
I nearly tested your breath.

742
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,070
Where are you going?

743
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,480
Go home.

744
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,210
I will send you back.

745
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,330
Don't bother

746
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,430
I can go back myself.

747
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:48,910
What's your problem?

748
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,550
Blow hot and cold to me

749
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,740
Mr Lu.

750
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,670
Maybe you get the wrong feelings.

751
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,150
My feet has no feelings.

752
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,840
Scissors.

753
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,720
What are you laughing about?

754
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:35,910
I'm not laughing.

755
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,220
Maybe don't wash it.

756
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,270
After you take off the bandage.

757
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,830
If I don't have a shower for five days

758
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,720
Mr Zhang

759
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,700
will you throw me out?

760
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:56,630
It sounds reasonable.

761
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,400
But I think you shouldn't
have a shower tonight.

762
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:13,760
After all, your wound hasn't recovered.

763
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,900
It's alright.

764
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,760
I can do it.

765
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:17,730
Don't be worried.

766
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,400
Ok, I am taking a shower.

767
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,370
Go out

768
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,940
I will go for you after shower.

769
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,100
I didn't want an answer from you.

770
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,840
To be frank,

771
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:32,990
I do feel much better now

772
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,580
than before.

773
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,290
But even in this case.

774
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,950
I cannot cheat myself

775
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,430
or you anymore.

776
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,570
Yun Shu.

777
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,200
What's the matter?

778
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:49,910
I am fine.

779
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,400
Just slipped.

780
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,000
Is it serious?

781
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:53,960
It's OK

782
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,020
I can get up myself.

783
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,150
Be careful.

784
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,970
May I come in?

785
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,670
No.

786
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,830
Don't! Mr Zhang!

787
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,470
I am just wearing a batherobe.

788
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,070
Nothing inside.

789
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:13,659
♫ Turning off the lights
in search of its trace ♫

790
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:09,670
Can you get up?

791
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,270
Be careful.

792
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:20,080
♫ I walk steadily
on the path beneath my feet ♫

793
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,600
Yun Shu

794
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:18,590
I am in.

795
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:26,080
♫ I hear someone asking,
are you still here? ♫

796
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,320
Where are you?

797
00:32:26,489 --> 00:32:32,280
♫ The kind person replies,
I've always been here ♫

798
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,440
♫ This love cuts through the crowd
in search of me ♫

799
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,730
♫ It isn't easy ♫

800
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,540
I...

801
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,020
Just in front of you.

802
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,600
♫ I only wish to cherish it with you ♫

803
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:39,699
Don't move

804
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,840
I am walking toward you.

805
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,800
♫ Each and every moment ♫

806
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,179
Grab on my hand.

807
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,000
♫ If I missed out, I will meet you again
in another lifetime ♫

808
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:57,350
♫ I recognise your eyes,
a secret that belongs to me ♫

809
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:51,860
Where is your wound?

810
00:32:51,949 --> 00:32:54,120
Arm and leg.

811
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,090
Did it bleed?

812
00:32:55,429 --> 00:32:56,460
No

813
00:32:56,719 --> 00:32:57,909
I will take you out now.

814
00:32:59,699 --> 00:33:02,550
Hold me on my neck.

815
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,160
Another hand.

816
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,400
Grab it tight.

817
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,950
Are you ready?

818
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,510
I am opening my eyes now

819
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,600
♫ The night will pass,
I am the dawn ♫

820
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,640
♫ Protecting this innocence,
evident in your eyes ♫

821
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,940
♫ I hear someone asking,
do dreams come to an end? ♫
