[Episode 14]

4
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,040
Are you hurt?

5
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:47,960
No.

6
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:48,930
Does it hurt now?

7
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,290
No.

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,840
Then I am going back.

9
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,740
If you need anything,

10
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:55,710
let me know immediately.

11
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,050
One more thing.

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,470
No showers from now on.

13
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,320
Take care of yourself.

14
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,480
Mr Zhang.

15
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,150
What's the matter?

16
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,060
Did you forget something here?

17
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,990
Your slippers here.

18
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,800
Are you here to visit me

19
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,810
or fight a cold war?

20
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,130
Of course to take care of you.

21
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,110
But he

22
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,080
just follows me.

23
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,620
I am not so bored.

24
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,200
I am also here for Yun Shu.

25
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,150
Really?

26
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,220
But why didn't you come by

27
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,010
when Yun Shu was in the hospital?

28
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,580
I told you

29
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,850
I was on leave yesterday.

30
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,520
All right. All right.

31
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,860
What's going on with you two?

32
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,730
My date with Gu Xiao was going well.

33
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,250
Then he started stalking me.

34
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,020
No, it's not like that.

35
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,820
I was afraid Gu Xiao might
have an ulterior motive

36
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,660
and take advantage of Gao Zhi Yi.

37
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,580
So, I came here.

38
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,770
Me? Taken advantage of?

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,510
I think you're the one taking
advantage of me.

40
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,350
Gao Zhi Yi.

41
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,310
All I did was ruin your wish

42
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,240
of sleeping with him.

43
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,410
Sleeping with him?

44
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,570
Yi Yi.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,140
You're a girl, after all.

46
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:23,080
You ought to be chaste.

47
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,229
Lin Nuo.

48
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,760
You, buzz off

49
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,800
I'll get out.

50
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,280
Well, Yi Yi.

51
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,820
Just go back.

52
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,070
Why?

53
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,940
I have much work to do.

54
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,050
Or I can't finish.

55
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,390
Wow, you'll work with injuries!

56
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,670
When did you become so working-hard?

57
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:40,990
Mr Zhang

58
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,290
recommended me.

59
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,280
I need to be serious about it,

60
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,800
so that I won't disgrace him.

61
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,640
Alright.

62
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,180
The power of love is great.

63
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,460
It can transform a person.

64
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:49,930
Alright.

65
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,640
Lin Nuo, you can also
accompany Yi Yi to the outside.

66
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,700
No, thanks.

67
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:54,820
Bye.

68
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,800
Look!

69
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,770
Go!

70
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,520
What?

71
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,440
Why don't you go first?

72
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,270
Why don't I give you a ride?

73
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,450
No, thanks.

74
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,330
I have nothing to say to you.

75
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,490
Yi Yi.

76
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,110
I...

77
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,990
Last time I followed you
on your date with Gu Xiao.

78
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,240
It's my fault.

79
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,190
But I'm really worried about you.

80
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,230
Lin Nuo,

81
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:40,160
I know you did it for my sake.

82
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:41,840
But do you know?

83
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,220
I feel burdened

84
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:44,390
when you're too nice to me.

85
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,150
But I just want you to live a good life.

86
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,030
Because I know you too well.

87
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,110
When you fall in love with someone,

88
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,550
you will

89
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,260
do so much for him.

90
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,230
I know you've treated me well.

91
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,780
But Gu Xiao is really good to me.

92
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,270
Do you remember?

93
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,840
Three years ago,

94
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,680
I said I wanted to go to Jay's concert.

95
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:04,990
But you said,

96
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,620
what's so interesting about that?

97
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,040
It's total chaos.

98
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,690
Noisy, crowded and stuffy.

99
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,120
It's good to be home watching TV.

100
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,310
But two days earlier,

101
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,010
I casually mentioned it to Gu Xiao.

102
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,390
For my sake,

103
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,160
he went to stand in line
overnight and got a VIP ticket.

104
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,250
Lin Nuo.

105
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,930
You don't know Gu Xiao.

106
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,140
You shouldn't judge

107
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,350
our relationship.

108
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,210
Sorry, Yi Yi.

109
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,670
I won't dwell on it anymore.

110
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,470
Lin Nuo.

111
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,670
Are you...

112
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,480
No.

113
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,690
No... No...

114
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,110
I just want you to be
happy for no purpose.

115
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,650
Just like I also hope.

116
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,180
Yun Shu would be happy as well.

117
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,309
Thanks.

118
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:32,740
Are you all right?

119
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,300
It's alright.

120
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,920
I told you not to move.

121
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,690
I forgot to take a file.

122
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,870
Where's the file?

123
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,400
This?

124
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:48,720
Yep.

125
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,680
Thanks.

126
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,120
What are you looking at?

127
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,910
Lawyer Meng has agreed
to take Gao Mei's case.

128
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,330
Now we need to review
the background of the case

129
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,640
and recheck these

130
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,930
documents.

131
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,520
Lawyer Meng.

132
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,570
Doesn't he have any other assistant?

133
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,690
Well.

134
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,750
He agreed to handle this case

135
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,260
because of me.

136
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,580
So I can't just relax.

137
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,110
I need to help him.

138
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,990
You're putting the cart before the horse.

139
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,760
You were injured in the company.

140
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,170
So you should rest at home.

141
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,660
This is for you.

142
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,530
By the way,

143
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,370
I have to tell you,

144
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,190
I've already got this full-time job.

145
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,520
Every formal employee in our company

146
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,500
will be able to get

147
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,870
an accident insurance security.

148
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,069
The accident insurance policy.

149
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,069
Do you know

150
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,079
what it means?

151
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,829
That means good company benefits.

152
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:45,850
Of course not.

153
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,420
That means this kind of accident happens

154
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,760
a lot in your company.

155
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:53,970
Lift the leg.

156
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,700
This is for you.

157
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,350
By the way,

158
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,420
speaking of compensation,

159
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,380
I have to tell you,

160
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,130
I've already got this full-time job.

161
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,510
Every formal employee in our company

162
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,490
will be able to get

163
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,750
an accident insurance security.

164
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:35,900
Mr Zhang.

165
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,440
What's up?

166
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,400
Lawyer Meng.

167
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,090
I heard that Yun Shu said

168
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,790
you bought her an
accident insurance policy.

169
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,050
Yeah.

170
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:43,730
What's the matter?

171
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,190
Every employee has one.

172
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,310
Or just only for Yun Shu.

173
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,440
Every employee!

174
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,400
OK.

175
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,530
Sorry.

176
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:55,760
But because Yun Shu needs it,

177
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,520
I bought it for everyone.

178
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:58,910
Bye bye.

179
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,880
Got it.

180
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,120
Liane.

181
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,450
To summarize.

182
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,740
Get accident insurance for everyone.

183
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,130
There are some accidents occurring.

184
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,390
That's why it's so pasting.

185
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,190
It's alright.

186
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,990
It's more cooked.

187
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,870
Better for digestion.

188
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,280
I'll give you my half.

189
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,590
What's the matter?

190
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,790
This one doesn't taste good either?

191
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,590
No.

192
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,190
I'm thinking about work.

193
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,020
Eat first.

194
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,360
I'll help you after that.

195
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,910
All the files you need are here.

196
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,330
It's all here.

197
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,250
Are there any other clues?

198
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:36,740
No.

199
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,010
Lawyer Meng also said.

200
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,440
Gao Mei's chances of winning
a property distribution claim

201
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,820
are really low.

202
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,320
There's not enough evidence right now.

203
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,450
To prove her husband's
concealment of assets.

204
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,040
I got Mr Meng into trouble.

205
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,710
He's never lost.

206
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,330
Now I'm asking him to take the case

207
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,050
and letting him experience failure
for the first time in his life.

208
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,950
[Shenzhen Yongtai Law Firm,
Professional Lawyer]

209
00:09:59,410 --> 00:09:59,990
Mr Zhang,

210
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,120
I have revised the contract.

211
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,360
I'll send it to you.

212
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,970
What are you doing?

213
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,460
You even look good in your ID photo.

214
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,610
Even my ID photo

215
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,780
is very ugly.

216
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,010
Why did you touch my picture?

217
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,150
I didn't touch it.

218
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,040
Mei asked me to give it to you.

219
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,380
By the way,

220
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,740
do you still have your ID?

221
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,100
Can I have two copies, please?

222
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
I have a necklace

223
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:24,900
that holds pictures.

224
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,770
Have you finished your work yet?

225
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,760
I've done my job.

226
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,880
Please check.

227
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,300
How do you feel?

228
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,660
Did you do all this by yourself?

229
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,680
You told me to.

230
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,420
How can I hand it to anyone?

231
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,390
Not bad.

232
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:46,850
Keep trying.

233
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,810
"Not bad?"

234
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,390
Coming from the mouth

235
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,370
of someone beautiful,

236
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,950
these words more satisfying
than getting 100 points.

237
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,970
Don't be smooth-talking.

238
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,410
I've been trying so hard.

239
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,020
Can you promise me

240
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,250
one little thing?

241
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,430
Go ahead, if it's official.

242
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,130
No more personal matters.

243
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,040
It's the key moment to experience life.

244
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,920
Come on.

245
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,790
Are you sure you don't
want to see it again?

246
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,280
Your writers have no experience.

247
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,030
It's a waste of time.

248
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,000
Go ahead.

249
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,570
OK

250
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,530
Witnesses.

251
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,430
I'm asking you a question now.

252
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,800
You said you were home
at the time of the murder.

253
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,070
And you know nothing at all.

254
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:31,970
Right?

255
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,940
Yes.

256
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,790
I was watching TV.

257
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,390
Actually, I didn't hear
anything next door.

258
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,450
Think carefully.

259
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,850
Everything you say right now

260
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,120
has legal implications.

261
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,290
I know.

262
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,720
Everything I said is true.

263
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,160
Then I'll ask you.

264
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,060
What' the program on TV

265
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,720
at that time?

266
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,490
A French movie.

267
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,930
-Meet in Paris-

268
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,810
According to the network
company's report on that day.

269
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,270
There's a wiring problem
in your community.

270
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,830
The whole community is offline.

271
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,990
Under such circumstances,

272
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,520
how did you watch TV?

273
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:10,060
I was watching a DVD.

274
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,460
Let me remind you again.

275
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,490
Falsification of evidence is also a crime.

276
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,180
No,

277
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,300
OK

278
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,670
Then I'll ask you again.

279
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,680
At the time of the crime,

280
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,630
what is the plot of the movie about?

281
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,340
Evan was saying goodbye to Judy.

282
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,460
You can stop your show now.

283
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,740
At first, you said

284
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,050
you didn't know anything because
you were watching TV at home.

285
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,810
But when I told you about
the condition of off-line.

286
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,980
You told me you were watching a DVD again.

287
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,220
And when I asked

288
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,060
contents of the film at
the time of the murder.

289
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,480
You can speak out

290
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,670
the plot in the movie clearly.

291
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,910
But you missed one point.

292
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,760
From the beginning until the end,

293
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,570
I didn't say when it happened.

294
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,540
You don't know the time of the murder.

295
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,740
How is it possible to say it clearly

296
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,100
about the plot in the movie?

297
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:58,280
Because...

298
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,040
Because you were at the crime scene

299
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,090
from the beginning.

300
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,350
"Meeting in Paris"

301
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,600
was shown at the scene of the crime.

302
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,010
That's right.

303
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,750
At the moment Evan was
saying goodbye to Judy.

304
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,620
You are amazing.

305
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,770
Okay.

306
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,010
I have to work.

307
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,960
Baby, you look so cool when you do that.

308
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,820
Let me down.

309
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:30,530
Ms Lan.

310
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,730
This is the material that
Mr Han asked me to give you

311
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,990
I'll... I'll come back later

312
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,040
I'll come here later.

313
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,220
Let go.

314
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,520
If you go nuts again,

315
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,630
then get out of the job.

316
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:42,700
Honey.

317
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,280
Before I get your heart,

318
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,030
I'll never leave my job.

319
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,660
Come on!

320
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:50,610
Look.

321
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,410
On September 15,

322
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,920
Tesla started a new round of price cuts

323
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,290
in China.

324
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,630
On October 21, 2019,

325
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,990
he purchased a car with a
full payment of 1.16 million yuan.

326
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,790
But

327
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,570
not the reduced price.

328
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,340
And it's a one-time payment for the car.

329
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,530
Could it be that he didn't know about it?

330
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,500
That's impossible.

331
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,920
Tesla's flagship store

332
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,060
has a relevant
description of the practices.

333
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,030
Besides,

334
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,900
interest-free instalment
were also available at the time.

335
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,430
Interest-free instalment?

336
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,750
Think about it.

337
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,740
According to the records we
looked into his purchases at the time.

338
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,800
The number of annual instalments.

339
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,490
Up to 118 times.

340
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,250
That's equal to

341
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,320
monthly instalments of...

342
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:34,990
Ten times.

343
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,960
That's right.

344
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,970
A man used to paying in instalments,

345
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,230
even when he's buying a rice cooker

346
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,720
worth 200 yuan,

347
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:42,500
then...

348
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,740
How could he possibly have paid

349
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,790
for a 100-million-yuan in one go?

350
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,950
So I think it's a breakthrough.

351
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,210
You can go talk to her ex-husband.

352
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,840
That according to what you say.

353
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,500
His invoice for the

354
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,260
car is probably false?

355
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,960
It's against the law.

356
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,160
You could say that.

357
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,870
I'll call right now

358
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,460
I'll tell Mr Meng the news.

359
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,040
OK

360
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,070
Sister.

361
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,269
What are you doing here?

362
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,239
What's wrong with your leg?

363
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,420
Where’s Zhang Si Nian?

364
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,640
Why is it you who's getting the door?

365
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,180
Mr Zhang went out for school.

366
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:31,540
Sister.

367
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,050
What do you want to see him about?

368
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,690
Why didn't you tell me that you are hurt?

369
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:35,890
You kept it from me!

370
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:36,950
Zhang Si Nian didn't tell me either.

371
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,570
It was Gao Zhi Yi who told me that.

372
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,460
Nothing serious.

373
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,470
It's alright.

374
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,640
Sis.

375
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,600
Have a seat.

376
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,690
Sister,

377
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,100
I'm fine.

378
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,370
Don't get angry

379
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,210
I've told him the day you got married

380
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,410
that I can't let you suffer.

381
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,270
I am not suffering.

382
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,390
This really has nothing to do

383
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,590
with Mr Zhang.

384
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,270
You're his wife.

385
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,120
Now, you are living here.

386
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,640
Why does it have nothing to do with him?

387
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,390
Sister.

388
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,380
Don't worry.

389
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,940
Mr Zhang is very good to me.

390
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,760
Ever since the day I hurt my leg,

391
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,330
he does the housework and the dishes.

392
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:11,840
And,

393
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,120
the time I took a shower...

394
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,860
Shower?

395
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,990
Anyway, Mr Zhang

396
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,730
is very good to me.

397
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,700
Don't worry.

398
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,970
What's the situation between you two
right now?

399
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,560
What?

400
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,220
No more talking!

401
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,640
Does Zhang Si Nian like you now?

402
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,700
I think he likes me.

403
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,500
But sometimes I think not.

404
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,580
And do you like him?

405
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,470
Sure I do.

406
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,960
I made a promise to Dad

407
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:46,870
to protect you.

408
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:47,990
That's why you're

409
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,240
always a kid in my eyes.

410
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,230
But now I find out...

411
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,450
Actually,

412
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,460
you're quite braver than me sometimes.

413
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,530
Sister.

414
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,590
Get out of the way.

415
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,300
I wonder why you eat

416
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,900
these junk food without any nutrition.

417
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,310
What do you have in the fridge?

418
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,910
I'll get you something to eat.

419
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,080
Meat.

420
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,080
Meat?

421
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,640
You'll get fat.

422
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm injured.

423
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,110
Mr Liu.

424
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,280
You've read all the papers.

425
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,500
I think you will agree with

426
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,190
the property division scheme

427
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,550
we proposed.

428
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,340
This is impossible!

429
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,480
I'll see you in court.

430
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,190
If that's your attitude,

431
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,130
that will cause you

432
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,620
to lose your Vankely house.

433
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,430
Don't talk nonsense.

434
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,360
I will handle it.

435
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,400
For real estate, the properties
at Nanshan Fuli Town,

436
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,420
Overseas Chinese Town,

437
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,970
and Vankely should belong to our party.

438
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,020
As for the bank account,
we split 50-50.

439
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,140
The child should be
brought up by the two parties.

440
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,230
For marital debt.

441
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,970
We will manage 70 percent.

442
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,360
You 30 percent.

443
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,020
That would be impossible.

444
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,250
For real estate, the house
at Vankely will go to you.

445
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,990
Marital debt borne by you.

446
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,940
All the cash in the bank
account belongs to our party.

447
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,150
As for the child,

448
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,600
the mother should get custody.

449
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,690
Lawyer Meng.

450
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,640
That is not the right
attitude to negotiate.

451
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,650
Let me tell you what
the right attitude is.

452
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,400
Assets transfer within marriage.

453
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,290
Fabrication of false evidence.

454
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,940
Purchase of fake VAT invoices.

455
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,850
You are a lawyer.

456
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,400
If I submit these pieces of evidence
to the judge,

457
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,080
what would he think?

458
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,380
Lawyer Meng.

459
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,900
Then I'll go on with work.

460
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,960
OK

461
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
Lawyer Meng.

462
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,740
Thank you so much.

463
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,810
I cannot take the credit, Miss Mei.

464
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,620
That's Yun Shu

465
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,540
who helped a lot.

466
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,600
She found the evidence
of asset concealment.

467
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,590
So.

468
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,640
You should thank her, really.

469
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,050
Certainly.

470
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:59,310
It is a kind of self-respect to
experience the torment of love.

471
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,450
Hello.

472
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,550
Really?

473
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,680
Congratulations, Miss Mei.

474
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,150
Welcome.

475
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,210
My pleasure.

476
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,640
Then, see you next time.

477
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,520
Hello, Yun Shu.

478
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,960
Hello, Lawyer Meng.

479
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,970
Tell you a piece of good news.

480
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,050
The case of Gao Mei was settled.

481
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:37,670
I know.

482
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,440
She told me just now.

483
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,540
Lawyer Meng.

484
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,870
You are awesome!

485
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,690
You deserve the most credit.

486
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:45,870
How do you feel?

487
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,800
It's the first to win a lawsuit.

488
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:48,940
Feel good?

489
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,420
A little proud

490
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,680
and pleased.

491
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,740
So

492
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,980
maybe we can celebrate it.

493
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,840
Celebrate?

494
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,050
Today?

495
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,480
When our company wins a case,

496
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,870
we will celebrate it

497
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,340
to enhance the team work.

498
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:07,970
Will you come?

499
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,940
Well, I will.

500
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,160
Then I will send you the
address and time later.

501
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,010
See you later.

502
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,980
Bye.

503
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:18,970
Everybody.

504
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,080
One thing here.

505
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,410
The case of Gao Mei has
been settled successfully.

506
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,390
OK

507
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,300
And today is the weekend.

508
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,590
So, after work,

509
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,820
let's have a gathering

510
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,170
and celebrate.

511
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,380
Thank you, Mr Meng.

512
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,950
But it's the first time to
have a Celebration Party

513
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,590
for winning a lawsuit!

514
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,440
It is OK to dine together.

515
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,640
Who cares?

516
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,370
Mr Zhang

517
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,970
I just think

518
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,870
it's not good for you to
accompany me there.

519
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,180
Is there any problem?

520
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,670
Er, if you go with me

521
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,340
how do I introduce you to others

522
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,760
about our relationship.

523
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,530
Cousin.

524
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:12,950
Yeah.

525
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,770
He is my cousin.

526
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,510
Because I got injured recently

527
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,130
and can't get around easily,

528
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,810
I asked my cousin to join me.

529
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,910
I am Yun Shu's cousin.

530
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,090
Liane,

531
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,360
take care of her cousin.

532
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,300
Sit down, please, cousin.

533
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,270
I will get this done.

534
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,560
Yun Shu.

535
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,800
You just have such a handsome cousin.

536
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,910
Is he single?

537
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,460
We're also

538
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,330
curious.

539
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,300
Tell us.

540
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,120
I'm married.

541
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,210
Everybody is here.

542
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,060
Let's order.

543
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,020
Alright.

544
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,010
Yun Shu.

545
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,980
What do you want to eat?

546
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,690
Shall I order a bird's nest for you.

547
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,450
High in protein.

548
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,970
Good for wound healing.

549
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,500
Never mind, Lawyer Meng.

550
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,730
It's too generous of you.

551
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,660
Never mind.

552
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,300
You bring good luck to the company.

553
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:17,830
Lawyer Meng.

554
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,010
Yun Shu got injured

555
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,040
as soon as she joined your company.

556
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,070
How can she be the
lucky star of your company?

557
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,140
Yun Shu was the biggest contributor

558
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,450
in this case.

559
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,980
Of course she's our lucky star.

560
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,860
Right, everyone?

561
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,440
We're also.

562
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,500
Yes, yes, yes.

563
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,350
Come on.

564
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,110
Yes.

565
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,830
Come here.

566
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,720
Let us drink for the lucky star.

567
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,890
Come on, cheers!

568
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,890
Come here.

569
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:39,850
Yun Shu.

570
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,260
She cannot drink.

571
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,120
She has not recovered yet.

572
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,980
She can just drink water.

573
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,710
Yun Shu.

574
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:57,800
You drink water.

575
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,030
We drink wine.

576
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,330
Come here.

577
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,530
Let us drink for the lucky star.

578
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:01,850
Come here.

579
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,930
Cheers!

580
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,450
Let us play a game together.

581
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,450
Okay, okay.

582
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,360
Alright.

583
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,140
Let me show you the game rules.

584
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,440
First, we should write
down a subject or behaviour

585
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,850
on a paper slip.

586
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,250
And then, we have a random draw

587
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,800
before placing the slip on the forehead.

588
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,060
But one cannot

589
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,870
peek at the content of the slip.

590
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,180
And then we can propose
questions toward each other.

591
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:29,920
Chatting.

592
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,100
And if anybody talks
of the content on the slip

593
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,980
by accident,

594
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,300
that person should be
deemed losing the game.

595
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,340
Are you ready?

596
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:35,790
Get it ready.

597
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,140
Let us begin.

598
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,820
Who will take the lead?

599
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,200
I'll go first.

600
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:41,680
Lawyer Meng,

601
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,440
what do you think of Yun Shu?

602
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,350
[Meng Ran]

603
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:47,880
I think she's great.

604
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,670
Yun Shu.

605
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,400
If you could choose
Lawyer Meng as your boyfriend,

606
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,550
[Yun Shu]

607
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,490
would you?

608
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,850
Quit kidding.

609
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,430
There's someone beside you.

610
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,750
Liane, you lose.

611
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,060
Out.

612
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:04,560
Out.

613
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,450
You're making fun of us?

614
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,420
You.

615
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,370
Out.

616
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:08,910
Just a fool.

617
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,460
You three, just this kind of IQ,

618
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,360
I will re-consider the year-end
allowance and dividends.

619
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,040
No.

620
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,590
Cousin is making the bad.

621
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,440
We're also.

622
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,800
The cousin beat the three of us

623
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,740
by himself with just one word.

624
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,280
Yun Shu.

625
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,510
What's Lawyer Meng's full name?

626
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,720
Meng Ran.

627
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,020
Yes.

628
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,620
It is my turn now.

629
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,560
Cousin.

630
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,520
Can I stay at your house tonight?

631
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,950
You wish.

632
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,910
Will you accept keeping a pet?

633
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,010
What is the score?

634
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,030
I just ask one question.

635
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,510
Among your many assistants,

636
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,100
who is the best one?

637
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,450
Of course Yun Shu.

638
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,220
Yun Shu.

639
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,030
Good job!

640
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,220
The game can end now.

641
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,260
Come here.

642
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:05,740
Everybody, bottoms up.

643
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,650
Cheers!

644
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,480
Cheers!

645
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,470
Come on, cheers, cheers.

646
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,030
Come here.

647
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,030
Yun Shu.

648
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,170
Yun Shu.

649
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,000
Go home.

650
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,210
Nobody can be the leading role forever.

651
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,610
Ugly ducklings will become
white swans, one day.

652
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:43,890
See.

653
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,410
Yun Shu becomes more
and more like the Heroine.

654
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,710
You shouldn't leave her alone.

655
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,920
Your colleagues have got loaded.

656
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,090
Zhang Si Nian.

657
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,120
Let us compete fairly.

658
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,140
What do you want to compete on?

659
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,630
From our schooling.

660
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,330
You are the first, and I am second.

661
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,650
And I accepted my second place readily.

662
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,410
I did not want to
compete with you.

663
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,560
But this time,

664
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,050
I want to go into a
competition against you.

665
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,560
Yun Shu is not an object.

666
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:17,540
She shouldn't be the trophy

667
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,240
of our competition.

668
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,620
I want to compete against you

669
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,430
not because I want to beat you

670
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,690
but because I really like Yun Shu.

671
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,100
What do you like about her?

672
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,600
Before meeting Yun Shu, I often thought,

673
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,290
what kind of woman

674
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,420
could make the proud Mr Zhang

675
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,930
do something as crazy as get into a
contractual relationship?

676
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:36,810
Then I discovered

677
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,290
the lovely character of Yun Shu.

678
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,110
She is clumsy but hardworking,

679
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,670
kind and optimistic.

680
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,030
The words of Lawyer Meng

681
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,090
must be said to a
number of girls, I think.

682
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,470
Yes.

683
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,490
Although those characteristics
are common and general

684
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,500
they are special

685
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,510
in Yun Shu.

686
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,470
Especially when she got injured,

687
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,550
I'm even more certain

688
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,300
why you chose her.

689
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,660
Tell me about it!

690
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,910
Because she is additive.

691
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,940
She is worthy of our love.

692
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,990
She will make us find
it too hard to leave her.

693
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,630
I hope

694
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,280
you can pay attention to your wording.

695
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,180
Yun Shu is my legitimate wife.

696
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,800
To be exact,

697
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,850
she is your legitimate contractual wife.

698
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,220
Zhang Si Nian.

699
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,480
From today onwards,

700
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,660
I will seriously pursue Yun Shu.

701
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,560
Mr Zhang.

702
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,750
What are you two doing here?

703
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,870
Go on.

704
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,200
I have to go.

705
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,380
Thanks.

706
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,030
Mr Zhang.

707
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,010
Do you feel that you and him in the Comic

708
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,990
I'm not like him.

709
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,910
I mean,

710
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,630
don't you think

711
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,070
his friends are all very cute and lovely?

712
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,550
-He does not have any friends-

713
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,080
Then you are perfectly different from him.

714
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,020
You have so many awesome friends.

715
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,940
Lu Yu and Meng Ran.

716
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,910
Stop.

717
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,370
Meng Ran is not my friend.

718
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,390
He is just my classmate.

719
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,070
But he said he and you

720
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,190
are close friends.

721
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,350
That is just his foolish sentiment.

722
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,580
You said Lawyer Meng
is foolishly sentimental.

723
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,040
Does he have special feelings toward you?

724
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,110
Do not think so.

725
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:40,090
Mr Zhang.

726
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,160
Are you OK?

727
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,200
No.

728
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,810
According to my theoretical analysis,

729
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,920
when a man,

730
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,970
a perfect man,

731
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,680
a steady perfect man,

732
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,710
could have become flawed,

733
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,460
that means...

734
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,910
What?

735
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,100
If anything abnormal goes on,
there must be a reason.

736
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,540
Yi Yi.

737
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,670
I didn't ask you out

738
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,330
so you could tell me things
that I already know.

739
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,600
I mean,

740
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:10,710
Yun Shu.

741
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,870
He likes you.

742
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,740
No, I think that is impossible.

743
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,210
Hey, do not spread this kind of news.

744
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,690
Unfounded words, OK?

745
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,350
You must believe me in my judgment.

746
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,250
The day after tomorrow
is your birthday, right?

747
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,420
If he really likes you,

748
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,070
he will show something.

749
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,120
Wait and see.

750
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,830
So you're going to celebrate
Yun Shu's birthday?

751
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,660
That's right.

752
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,260
You never celebrated your own birthdays.

753
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,670
And now you will
celebrate a girl's birthday.

754
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,780
I won't.

755
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,000
But you will.

756
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,150
You are clever.

757
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,720
I am good at it, to tell you the truth.

758
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:03,950
I'll say it.

759
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,920
You'll write it.

760
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,650
First, you must find a reason

761
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,460
to lure Yun Shu out of the office.

762
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,540
And when she's anxious to get back,

763
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,660
you keep up the act

764
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,350
and let her anxiety mount

765
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,870
until she's at her breaking point.

766
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,360
At this time, you can take
out your birthday present to her.

767
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,510
Then, she will forget
all the previous anxiety

768
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,050
and accept your love in a
great joy after a type of anxiety.

769
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:31,860
Got it?

770
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,520
Breakdown!

771
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,190
Deception!

772
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:34,660
Fear!

773
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,660
Anxiety!

774
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,530
This doesn't sound like

775
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,100
a happy birthday party.

776
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,060
What?

777
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:40,990
No.

778
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:41,950
Just surprising.

779
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,010
Forget it.

780
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,780
Then, you will not

781
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,010
understand my next-level ruse.

782
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,110
That is too hard for you.

783
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:47,930
Forget it.

784
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,710
I have overestimated you.

785
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,430
Your surprise, in fact, is too shallow.

786
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:56,940
Shallow?

787
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,410
Then you can give me a better one.

788
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,290
According to my plan.

789
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,360
At 3:00 p.m.,

790
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,040
take her to the University of Melbourne

791
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,610
to attend the special
lecture of Professor Stephen.

792
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,670
It is rich in content and unique in ideas.

793
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,080
It can improve Yun Shu's way of thinking.

794
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,980
After the lecture,

795
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,120
go with her to have supper at 6:00 p.m.

796
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,580
The supper time should not exceed 30 min.

797
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,510
After supper,

798
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,920
we can have a rest at home.

799
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,350
And from 8 to 10 p.m.,

800
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,730
have a test about the content

801
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,950
of the afternoon's lecture

802
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,380
to solidify knowledge.

803
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,710
Then at 10:30

804
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,150
eat one eighth of the cake

805
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,490
with the energy of not
surpassing two hundred calories.

806
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:38,930
At 10:00 on the dot,

807
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,040
the birthday song will be played.

808
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,590
After some celebrations,

809
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,780
calm down a bit.

810
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,820
And at 11: 00.

811
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,170
That will be the best time to go to sleep.

812
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,490
It'll ensure

813
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,080
a wonderful birthday experience

814
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,450
and a healthy body.

815
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,690
It doesn't sound like a birthday party.

816
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,770
More like punishment.

817
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,400
Your wisdom is not
enough to understand this.

818
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:05,970
On this birthday,

819
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,620
I will make it unforgettable for Yun Shu.

820
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,710
Continue.

821
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,380
Make her unforgettable.

822
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,809
Mr Zhang.

823
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,530
What's your arrangement
the day after tomorrow?

824
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,320
Now at the examination preparation stage.

825
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,369
Concentrate a bit.

826
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,809
The answer can be made
after the test is turned in.

827
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,970
Yun Shu.

828
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,840
Concentrate.

829
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:52,850
Time's almost up.

830
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,820
How are you getting on?

831
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,530
Here it is.

832
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,210
Mr Zhang,

833
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,420
I think in the last question,

834
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,390
there is some problem with my formula.

835
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:13,920
I must have a look

836
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,060
at the last question.

837
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,610
There is no problem with the formula.

838
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,630
But there is a simpler solution to it.

839
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,900
Is there any other problem?

840
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,150
Problem?

841
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,300
Yes, there is.

842
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,090
You must pay attention
to the clean and neat sheet.

843
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:48,220
All right.

844
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,670
It's late today.

845
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,360
Go to bed early.

846
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,170
Yun Shu.

847
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,610
The day after tomorrow is your birthday.

848
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,300
I will come back soon.

849
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,060
Mr Zhang.

850
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:53,770
Mr Zhang.

851
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,950
You are still here.

852
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,610
I will go after listening to this news.

853
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,390
I will be late, I must go now.

854
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,850
Wait, just wait.

855
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,720
What's the matter?

856
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,160
Get in the car.

857
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,260
I will drive you there.

858
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,300
Won't you be late for class?

859
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,520
If you get in the car now,

860
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,070
we won't be late.

861
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,700
♫ You're a familiar stranger ♫

862
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:27,140
♫ Who keeps appearing before me ♫

863
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,380
♫ You're clumsy yet kind ♫

864
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,900
♫ Ringing the bell in my heart ♫

865
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,740
♫ You predict and plan, but you can't
solve the problem called love ♫
