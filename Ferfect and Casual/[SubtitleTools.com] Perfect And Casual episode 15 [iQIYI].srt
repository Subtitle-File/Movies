[Episode 15]

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,410
Get in the car.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,510
I will drive you there.

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,750
Won't you be late for class?

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,870
If you get in the car now,

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,370
we won't be late.

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,740
Mr Zhang.

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,440
What to do?
There's a traffic jam.

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,400
There's indeed been an accident ahead.

12
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,210
This is not part of my plan.

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,620
We will be late for work.

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,980
Or I can get off

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,010
and walk down the congested street.

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,400
Then I'll take a taxi.

17
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,829
That's a good idea.

18
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,890
Well, watch your step when you get off.

19
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,860
Okay.

20
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,950
Wait a minute.

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,990
Someone is behind.

22
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,640
Ignore him.

23
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,840
Motorcycle robbery
often use these tactics.

24
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:02,810
It's dangerous.

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,300
Yun Shu.

26
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,160
It's me.

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,250
-Lawyer Meng?
-Mr Zhang.

28
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,550
Mr Zhang.

29
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,960
Stuck in the jam?

30
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,250
Yun Shu.

31
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,340
You'll lose your full
attendance bonus this month

32
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,010
if you're still here.

33
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:24,890
Mr Zhang.

34
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,579
I'm getting off.

35
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,410
Mr Zhang, hey.

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,520
Wait a minute.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,660
How can you?

38
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,200
Why did you step on the gas?

39
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,440
Look, your car crashed into my car.

40
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,570
Sorry.

41
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,970
Lawyer Meng?

42
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,150
I just got into an accident.

43
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,520
As my attorney,

44
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,530
I now demand that you

45
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,860
deal with this.

46
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,310
Don't you have insurance?

47
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,640
Besides, it's not office hours.

48
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,579
I won't take it.

49
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,740
According to our contract,

50
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,250
you need to provide 24/7 services.

51
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,300
Do you need me
to show you the terms?

52
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,870
What are you doing?

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,750
Yun Shu, get on.

54
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,350
You can ride a motorcycle?

55
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,450
Is there anything I can't do?

56
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,350
Go on.

57
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,000
Hold on.

58
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,150
Sir.

59
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,190
It's alright.

60
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,110
Nothing serious.

61
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,820
If you call me for such
trivial matters again,

62
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,530
I'll raise my agency fee.

63
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,610
Do I care?

64
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,790
Next year's consultant

65
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,860
may not be you.

66
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,040
Did you know?

67
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,370
I heard from Mei

68
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,230
that she saw Lu Yu holding Yun Lan

69
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,790
and twirling in the office.

70
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,040
By the way, was that Lu Yu who we saw

71
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,750
at the entrance last time?

72
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:48,950
It should be.

73
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,210
But I think

74
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,870
there was something between them.

75
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,110
That's why

76
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,200
Lu Yu is now an intern in our company.

77
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,750
And he is Yun Lan's assistant.

78
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,760
So clever.

79
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,040
Yun Lan has some brilliant tricks.

80
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,310
She just played

81
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,070
a cat-and-mouse game.

82
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,940
Well,

83
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,560
we really need to study from her.

84
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,160
Learn such tricks.

85
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,260
I think you should learn more than that.

86
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,130
Stop!

87
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,240
You should work harder

88
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,830
instead of gossiping.

89
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,790
Nevertheless,

90
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,990
I can also understand both of you.

91
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,880
After all, any woman would
be jealous and resentful.

92
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,720
Because Yun Lan is better than you.

93
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,430
You should indeed learn from her

94
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,580
in the aspects of self-motivation
and dedication.

95
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,930
She doesn't waste time
gossiping about others.

96
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,090
I'm indeed pursuing her.

97
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,370
I'm sincere about it.

98
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,530
It's not because of tricks
like cat-and-mouse

99
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,760
as you said.

100
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,570
Who said I didn't use tricks?

101
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,700
Yun Lan.

102
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,300
If not,

103
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,320
how could I have become
Lu Yu's girlfriend?

104
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:52,690
Why are you still here?

105
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,630
Where's our privacy?

106
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,330
Sorry, Miss Yun.

107
00:04:59,420 --> 00:04:59,880
Sorry!

108
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,850
It doesn't matter.

109
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,430
I would like to thank you

110
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,020
for giving me the courage.

111
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,450
My dear,

112
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,650
you have accepted me.

113
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,620
Why?

114
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,010
Are you regretting it?

115
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,910
No, of course not.

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,790
Yes, I have received it.

117
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,360
I'm so sorry to have
troubled you this time.

118
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:42,800
Okay.

119
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,960
No problem.

120
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,350
Yun Shu.

121
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:47,750
By the way.

122
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,470
If you are free,

123
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,270
I would like to take my client with me.

124
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:53,830
Okay.

125
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,130
Then, see you tonight.

126
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,240
Yun Shu,

127
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,900
I have something to tell you.

128
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,040
I made a decision

129
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,210
without consulting you.

130
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,480
Do you mind?

131
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,590
Mr Meng.

132
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,470
Are you going to sack me?

133
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,740
Why would I?

134
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,330
You are the lucky star of our company.

135
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,590
Why would I fire you?

136
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,880
You scared me.

137
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,000
This is the latest info on Huo Qi.

138
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,800
My cousin's?

139
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,060
Last time you told me that you
were cheated by your cousin,

140
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,700
I asked someone
to look into him in secret.

141
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,470
But I didn't tell you this matter

142
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,280
until I found his whereabouts recently.

143
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,679
Do you

144
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,940
think that I'm being nosey?

145
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:40,440
No, I don't.

146
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,580
That's good

147
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,179
I was afraid you would be angry.

148
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,150
No.

149
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,070
Mr Meng.

150
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,260
Thank you.

151
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,300
Are you free this evening?

152
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,880
I'm meeting the person
in charge of the investigation.

153
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,010
You can go with me

154
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,100
if you are free tonight,

155
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,850
as you have more
information than I have.

156
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,090
This can help us to find the
person we have been looking for.

157
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,220
Okay.

158
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,640
Just like what she said just now.

159
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,540
For this house, she was cheated out of
two million yuan or so by her cousin.

160
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,490
And I have also

161
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,360
prepared some materials today,

162
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,830
including

163
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,800
the personal information of her cousin,

164
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,850
the latest records of his communication

165
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,450
and the invoice for purchasing
the house at that time.

166
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,560
Okay. I have a rough idea of the case.

167
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,440
I will contact you
if there is any update.

168
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,370
Okay.

169
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,950
Thank you for your hard work, Cui.

170
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,550
-Thanks.
-Bye.

171
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,310
Mr Meng.

172
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,180
Thank you very much for today.

173
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,030
You've thanked me enough.

174
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,420
No need to be so polite.

175
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,490
Regarding this matter,

176
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,270
I will have to thank you
over and over.

177
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,780
Because it's really important for me

178
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,110
to find my cousin.

179
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,130
I know.

180
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,880
I can understand your feeling.

181
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,060
Because

182
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,730
I had a similar experience before.

183
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,190
I was deceived by a person I trusted.

184
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,400
Then?

185
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,260
Then, later on, I began studying law.

186
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,580
I told myself

187
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,650
to believe in the evidence

188
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,450
instead of believing in myself blindly.

189
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,350
Mr Zhang,

190
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,810
why are you still up?

191
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,520
You are back.

192
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,770
Have you had dinner yet?

193
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,970
I left some dishes for
you in the refrigerator.

194
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,940
I had dinner.

195
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,210
You came back so late.

196
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,610
Worked overtime again?

197
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,180
No,

198
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,170
I went along with Lawyer Meng
to meet a person.

199
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,170
Lawyer Meng?

200
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,880
Lawyer Meng was on purpose.

201
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,300
The Labour Law has clearly defined

202
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,400
the working hours per day

203
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,570
shall not be more than eight hours

204
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,550
Mr Zhang.

205
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,380
It was Lawyer Meng who helped me

206
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,820
and went with me to meet the person.

207
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,790
He...

208
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,670
accompanied you?

209
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,790
Who did you meet?

210
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,220
Lawyer Meng found an investigator

211
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,520
to look into my cousin's affairs.

212
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,770
I went to meet him

213
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,230
to exchange news and information.

214
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,020
Yun Shu.

215
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,000
If you want to find your cousin

216
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,130
in a fastest manner,

217
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,790
the most effective and quickest way is

218
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,980
to report him to the
public security bureau,

219
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,400
rather than try to solve it
on your own.

220
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,000
I really don't want to send my cousin

221
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,210
to the public security bureau.

222
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,570
But you can't deny

223
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,060
this is the most effective way.

224
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:19,930
Mr Zhang,

225
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,020
the guy Mr Meng found
is also efficient.

226
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,830
Maybe there will be news in a few days.

227
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,480
He just tried to get close to you
on purpose.

228
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,590
Get close to me?

229
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,350
Why?

230
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,070
It doesn't matter.

231
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,230
I just don't want you

232
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,140
to be disappointed.

233
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,400
Mr Zhang.

234
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,140
Lawyer Meng is quite reliable.

235
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,230
He didn't tell me the truth
before he got the result

236
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,040
because he was worried
I'd get disappointed.

237
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,190
So what's the result?

238
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,190
Here.

239
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,320
This is information about my cousin.

240
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,250
[You have changed yourself
so much for Wu Suo Wei,]

241
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,440
[and have done so much for him.]

242
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,590
[If you are still unhappy,]

243
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,800
[I, Nan Tian,]

244
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,200
[will not be happy either.]

245
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,420
Cheers!

246
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,160
I could tell,

247
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,930
you got drunk on purpose

248
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,140
that time when you had a drink abroad.

249
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,940
Those few days were the worst
during my time abroad.

250
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,480
They were more difficult than
when I first arrived.

251
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,820
To live a splendid life

252
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,240
in the rush of reality

253
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,140
is what we need to do most.

254
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,230
What nonsense are you talking about?

255
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,300
It's an old Chinese saying.

256
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,340
Your worst days

257
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,250
are also my happiest days.

258
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,320
Happy?

259
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,010
Yeah.

260
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,510
If you hadn't had the bad luck,

261
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,040
we wouldn't have been
acquainted with each other.

262
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,010
Maybe it is.

263
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,280
Cheers!

264
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,090
From today on,

265
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,020
I will help Yun Shu

266
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,070
to find her cousin.

267
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,370
You don't worry about it.

268
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,730
Don't forget,

269
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,190
it was you who let Yun Shu

270
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,880
ask me to help her look
into the affairs of Huo Qi.

271
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,410
It seems that I haven't
made it clear enough.

272
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,590
So, I'm now giving you a
formal notice, Mr Meng.

273
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,070
You need not concern yourself
with this matter.

274
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,740
Sorry.

275
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,000
This matter is now a personal one.

276
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,250
You have no right to decide it.

277
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,930
Then, I guess I need to remind you

278
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,470
to not cross the line.

279
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,510
Cross the line?

280
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,410
Whose? Yours?

281
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,350
Or Yun Shu's?

282
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,650
It is the line between you and me.

283
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,970
You needn't worry about that.

284
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,030
I will establish a new
relationship with Yun Shu

285
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,670
after your contract with her ends.

286
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,220
How dare you!

287
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,520
Why don't I dare?

288
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,350
The relationship between you and Yun Shu

289
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,240
only stands when in front of your grandpa.

290
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,320
So?

291
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,600
Why can't I help Yun Shu

292
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,240
in private?

293
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,280
Let me take care of Huo Qi's matter.

294
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,430
As a lawyer, I should

295
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,660
help my client solve the problem.

296
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,110
What did you say just now?

297
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,000
Investigation?

298
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,030
Trace?

299
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,740
Didn't you hear anything I said?

300
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,310
Were you ever in a suspense play before?

301
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,680
Share your experience with me.

302
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,400
Suspense play?

303
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,230
No, I didn't.

304
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,130
Aren't you a popular actor?

305
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,620
Our company once
tried to recommend me a suspense play,

306
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,080
but the story was too complicated.

307
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,280
I didn't understand it,

308
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,390
so I turned it down.

309
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,470
I have really overestimated you.

310
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,120
Back to the point.

311
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,770
Why are you doing an investigation?

312
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,780
I'm just trying to help
Yun Shu find her cousin.

313
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,850
Cousin?

314
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,420
It is the cousin who acted as a
matchmaker

315
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,810
and deceived Yun Shu into buying a house?.

316
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,460
Watch your wording.

317
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,400
Matchmaker?

318
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,480
Isn't he a matchmaker?

319
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,750
Without him, could both of you
have gotten married?

320
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,870
Are we not talking about the point?

321
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,510
Go ahead with your story.

322
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,680
According to some information

323
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,130
of Huo Qi provided by Meng Ran,

324
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,250
in the past ten days,

325
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,860
Huo Qi often visited a branch of
Yikang Pharmacy

326
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,600
on Juxian Road to shop.

327
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,210
He went there every three days

328
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,190
and the amount spent each time

329
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,400
was almost the same.

330
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,120
Therefore, according to my analysis,

331
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,850
Huo Qi is most likely injured.

332
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,210
Oh, Nian Nian,

333
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,470
you are so awesome!

334
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,120
You're really a modern-day
Sherlock Holmes!

335
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,940
Stop!

336
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,210
Today happens to be the day
for changing dressings.

337
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,250
I'm going to stake out

338
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,560
and catch Huo Qi.

339
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,290
And then?

340
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,400
And then...

341
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,320
I will persuade him to turn himself in.

342
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,110
I thought Yun Shu didn't want
to involve the police.

343
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,120
Now that he has broken the law,

344
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,160
he should be punished by the law.

345
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,120
This is also my principle.

346
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,570
As a legal worker,

347
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,660
I support you.

348
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,630
But

349
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,080
the law is no more than human nature!

350
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,370
It seems to make some sense.

351
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,600
Put it this way.

352
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,710
This depends on

353
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,950
what you deem more important,

354
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,520
Yun Shu or your principle?

355
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,350
By the way.

356
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,110
Tell you a piece of happy news!

357
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,630
I'm now your brother-in-law.

358
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,760
An elder?

359
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,390
At your age,

360
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,820
you've been considered

361
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,120
an old artist long ago.

362
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,410
I have been officially upgraded to

363
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,910
Yun Lan's boyfriend.

364
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,670
Yun Lan's boyfriend?

365
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,170
It's true.

366
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,420
Sure enough, Yun Lan

367
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,110
only looks smart.

368
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,830
What are you saying?

369
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:10,579
Dong Ge, go and eat.

370
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,369
The dishes today are really yummy.

371
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,720
Alright. I'll go and eat then.

372
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:13,690
Bye.

373
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,069
Could you please
order less dishes next time?

374
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:16,990
Since I always sponge off your lunch,

375
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:18,349
I feel kind of bad about it.

376
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,030
Only twin sets

377
00:15:20,109 --> 00:15:21,569
get a discount.

378
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,990
If you feel embarrassed,

379
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:24,970
you can return the hospitality.

380
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,530
Okay. Then I will treat you next time.

381
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,640
I know a restaurant with...

382
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,640
Gu Xiao?

383
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,670
You know him?

384
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,050
Mum, this is Gu Xiao.

385
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,330
How are you feeling today?

386
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,340
Take good care of yourself.

387
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,290
You needn't worry about
other things.

388
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,110
You're really something.

389
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,180
You have the aunty under control.

390
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,620
You can come here at any time.

391
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,320
Well, being lovable is also a gift,

392
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,290
so I can't help it.

393
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,180
I met Gu Xiao in the hospital yesterday.

394
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,230
He has a relative who is
going to have surgery.

395
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,810
So he has been busy with this matter.

396
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,100
Relative?

397
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,880
Do you know what relative?

398
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,960
Just a relative.

399
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,730
Why would I ask about that?

400
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,830
No, I mean...

401
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,880
Oh no,

402
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,650
I'm going to be late.

403
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,770
Remember to close the door
when you leave.

404
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,310
Hey, what's the hurry?

405
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,500
Didn't you make an appointment at 11:30?

406
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,270
I want to go Gu Xiao's company
in advance

407
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,500
to give him a surprise.

408
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,600
I will drive you there.

409
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:43,650
I...

410
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,790
I happen to be going that way.

411
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,550
Really?

412
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,520
Yes.

413
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,270
[Metro, Railway station]

414
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,930
Why is it so jammed?

415
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,460
Maybe you'd better not go.

416
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,200
Give up eating for fear of choking?

417
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,460
Miss the appointment
due to a traffic jam?

418
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,440
Are you crazy?

419
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,610
Yeah.

420
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
If I wasn't crazy,

421
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,340
would I send you to your date?

422
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,530
If Gu Xiao really wanted
to have a date with you,

423
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,200
he should pick you up.

424
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,390
I'm not that hypocritical.

425
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,660
Forget about it. I'd walk there.

426
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,620
Gu Xiao's company is just ahead.

427
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,220
Sir, drop me off here.

428
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,810
But what's the rush?

429
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,220
Your makeup will run.

430
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,650
Sir, drop me here.

431
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,090
How much?
I'll scan the QR code.

432
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,370
Yi Yi, wait!

433
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,370
Hurry up!

434
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,560
-Yi Yi.
-What's the matter?

435
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,710
Your hair is a mess.

436
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,600
Why not look at yourself in the mirror?

437
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,950
Flawless!

438
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:09,710
Yi Yi.

439
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,080
Now what?

440
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,510
Can I have a word with you?

441
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,280
Go ahead.

442
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,000
Let me go first.

443
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,480
Gu Xiao will see us.

444
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,450
Um...

445
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,300
Go ahead.

446
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,530
I... Um...

447
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,240
We broke up a long time ago,

448
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,930
but there is always a
place for you in my heart

449
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,940
I don't want to...

450
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,300
I don't want to make you sad.

451
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,420
I...

452
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,580
I'm not sad.

453
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,300
Actually I'm living a happy life now.

454
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,200
Can you just let me go?

455
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,960
Don't let Gu Xiao see us!

456
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:32,810
Hurry up!

457
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,590
No, I mean...

458
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,350
Just in case.

459
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,320
What if?

460
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,930
What if you get hurt again?

461
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,600
No way.

462
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,950
I won't let you go.

463
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,620
Lin Nuo.

464
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,840
If you dare,

465
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,510
I will slap you, believe it or not?

466
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,670
Please, don't do that!

467
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,120
Hey.

468
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,570
Don't go to meet him today.

469
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,540
Lin Nuo,

470
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,470
I'm going to lose my temper.

471
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,460
If you continue to behave like
this, we can't even be friends.

472
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,250
Finally.

473
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,210
Excuse me?

474
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,740
I said you can finally go.

475
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,480
I was just kidding.

476
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,050
What's wrong with you today?

477
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,760
Yi Yi.

478
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,670
Why are you here?

479
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,010
Didn't we arrange to meet
at the restaurant?

480
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,780
I wanted to surprise you!

481
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,120
-What do you think of my dress?
-Gu Xiao.

482
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,090
Very nice!

483
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,630
I left my mobile phone in your pocket.

484
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,670
Mobile phone.

485
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,800
Hello, I'm Gu Xiao's girlfriend.

486
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,820
I'm sorry, but

487
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,200
I need to talk to her.

488
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,080
Yi Yi.

489
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,740
You already knew about this, right?

490
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,460
I...

491
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,520
So you came here
to laugh at me, didn't you?

492
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,670
Yi Yi, that's not true.

493
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,710
Just leave me alone.

494
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,540
[Yun Shu, I'm terribly sorry.]

495
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,120
[I was held up by something just now.]

496
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,000
[I will be home at eight.]

497
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,180
[No problem, Mr Zhang.]

498
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,580
Yun Shu.

499
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,390
Could you do me a favour?

500
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,390
Today I'm going to meet

501
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,460
a very important guest.

502
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,890
Would you please
help me fix up a place for the meeting?

503
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,140
Here is the address.

504
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,370
You need to grab something first

505
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,620
before you go to the restaurant.

506
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,820
The restaurant manager will help you.

507
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,250
Huachu House, Flaubert Western Restaurant.

508
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,550
What do you mean by important guests?

509
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,890
Those vital to the
development of our law firm.

510
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:39,910
Okay.

511
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,690
I'll see it done.

512
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,270
Hello.

513
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,040
[Hello.]

514
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,140
[Hello, Mr Zhang.]

515
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,230
[Your cake is ready.]

516
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,600
[Do you need delivery?]

517
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,850
Yes, please deliver it.

518
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,770
[Will do.]

519
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,300
-I will send you the address later.
-[Okay.]

520
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,480
Please be sure to arrive before 8:00 p.m.

521
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,450
[Got it.]

522
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,330
Okay. Thanks.

523
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,280
Hello.

524
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,820
Miss Yun Shu, right?

525
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,800
Yes.

526
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,840
Leave it to me.

527
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,200
Okay.

528
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,340
Here you go.

529
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,840
It looks expensive.

530
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,150
Okay, please rest assured.

531
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,350
Mr Meng has a message for you.

532
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,500
Wait here.

533
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,500
He will be here soon.

534
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,230
Okay.

535
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,240
Also, Mr Meng has booked
the whole restaurant

536
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,690
so we cleared the place.

537
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,920
Only one attendant will be left.

538
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,100
After a while, I will leave.

539
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,960
If there is any problem,

540
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,160
you can turn to him.

541
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,140
Thank you.

542
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,830
Okay.

543
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,120
Then please follow me.

544
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,320
-Okay.
-This way.

545
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,110
Huo Qi.

546
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,320
Hello, Sis.

547
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,830
Tonight let's have dinner together.

548
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,560
But tonight...

549
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,630
Mr Zhang will wait for me at home.

550
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,030
You guys enjoy.

551
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,740
I have a meeting to attend later.
I‘ll hang up.

552
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,720
Okay.

553
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,740
By the way,

554
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,510
I have been busy these days.

555
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,890
I'll give you your birthday
present in a few days.

556
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,860
Thank you, Sis.

557
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,530
Bye.

558
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:04,010
[Mr Zhang, sorry! I'm still working.
I'll be home  abit late]

559
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,670
Huo Qi.

560
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:16,980
Stop!

561
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,720
[Police]

562
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,490
Since young,

563
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,760
aside from my sister,

564
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,580
he has been the closest person to me.

565
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,110
I just don't want him

566
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,440
to be ruined because of this.

567
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,510
You're here, Mr Meng.

568
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,430
Sorry, Yun Shu.

569
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,430
I was held up by something.

570
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,220
You had to wait.

571
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,250
It's okay.

572
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,080
I have delivered the item
to the restaurant.

573
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,710
I also decorated the place.

574
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,710
Looks good.

575
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,750
Yun Shu.

576
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,710
What do you say?

577
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,300
It's nice.

578
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,510
Cosy and low-key.

579
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,410
I'm glad you like it.

580
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,070
If there's nothing else,

581
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,330
I'm going to go.

582
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:29,540
♫ Why are two persons from
different worlds intertwined? ♫

583
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:35,580
♫ What kind of endings
will the different melody scores bring ♫

584
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:41,380
♫ Trying to find the secret of the fall ♫

585
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,260
♫ Who can differentiate
between reality and dream? ♫

586
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:52,290
♫ Listening to your footsteps,
getting closer ♫

587
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:57,730
♫ That is love, slowly,
gradually fermenting ♫

588
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:03,810
♫ Unsure how to express it,
choosing to be bold ♫

589
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:09,850
♫ This time, it will be
the most wonderful decision ♫

590
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,360
Happy birthday, Yun Shu.

591
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,970
[Yun Shu, happy birthday]

592
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,330
[Mr Zhang.]

593
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:37,780
[Sorry!]

594
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,860
[I'm still working.
I'll be home a bit late.]

595
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:06,770
Yun Shu.

596
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,650
I like you.

597
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,180
Mr Meng.

598
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,380
I'm married to Mr Zhang.

599
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:15,730
I know.

600
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,720
You and Mr Zhang have a
contractual marriage lasting one year.

601
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,810
But Yun Shu,

602
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,370
you shouldn't be bound by it.

603
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,620
You're entitled to be loved.

604
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,620
You're entitled to choose who to love.

605
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,000
But...

606
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,380
Zhang Si Nian knows everything.

607
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,990
Before I confessed my love to you,

608
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,540
I told him everything.

609
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,320
Then...

610
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,340
What did Mr Zhang say?

611
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,530
What did he say?

612
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,850
It doesn't matter.

613
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,270
No.

614
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,110
It is important to me.

615
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,080
Why?

616
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,070
Because I like him.

617
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,600
Yun Shu.

618
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,830
During human interaction,

619
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,600
we develop different affections

620
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,900
like family ties,

621
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,270
friendship,

622
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,310
love

623
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,410
or

624
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,220
even gratitude.

625
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,730
Gratitude?

626
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,900
When you were at your worst,

627
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,960
you met Zhang Si Nian.

628
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,500
He helped you get out of trouble

629
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,860
and overcome difficulties.

630
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,280
Then,

631
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,130
you held a wedding

632
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,070
and have been together since.

633
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,950
It's not surprising you have
developed feelings toward him.

634
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,300
But you need to know,

635
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,880
this feeling

636
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,440
is not necessarily love.

637
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,540
Then, Mr Meng.

638
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,330
What is love?

639
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,180
There is no exact answer.

640
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,420
But I know

641
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,440
your affection towards him

642
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,750
is anything but love.

643
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,270
I trust my own feelings more.

644
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,400
Yun Shu.

645
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,170
I truly

646
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,470
hope you can think about it

647
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,660
seriously.

648
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,810
You and Zhang Si Nian.

649
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,890
What exactly is your relationship?

650
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,540
I really have to go.

651
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,130
Then let me see you off.

652
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,100
It's okay.

653
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,000
Bye.

654
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,990
Sir.

655
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,930
Excuse me, can you drive a little faster?

656
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,080
I'm really in a rush.

657
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,750
Girl, this is a taxi,

658
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,880
not a plane.

659
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,160
Yun Shu.

660
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,600
Yun Shu.

661
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,570
Mr Meng?

662
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,980
Sorry.

663
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,590
I was too selfish just now

664
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,130
and didn't consider your feelings.

665
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,060
Love.

666
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,210
There has never been a
standard answer to that question.

667
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:03,690
Yun Shu,

668
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,450
I respect your feelings.

669
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,650
But meanwhile,

670
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,580
I also respect my own feelings.

671
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,360
Every year,

672
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,650
how many times will you
replace your phone?

673
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:15,880
Each year, I...

674
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:16,850
Professor Zhang.

675
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:17,970
Where are you going?

676
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,980
I'm going to pick up my wife.

677
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,360
You've forgotten your phone.

678
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,350
Thank you.

679
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,720
Go up.
