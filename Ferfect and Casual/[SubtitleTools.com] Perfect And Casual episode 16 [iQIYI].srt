[Episode 16]

4
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:32,760
Mr Zhang.

5
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,329
Why did you come so early today?

6
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,090
I'll get changed.

7
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,710
I'll go with you after that.

8
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,440
And

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,670
last night.

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,290
Sorry.

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,260
Sorry!

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,220
I have something else to handle today.

13
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,570
I can't drive you to work.

14
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,290
Yun Shu.

15
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,550
Happy birthday!

16
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,100
Thanks.

17
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,520
Morning.

18
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,100
Morning.

19
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:19,570
Morning, Yun Shu.

20
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,540
Good morning.

21
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,370
Morning.

22
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,020
Morning, Mr Guan!

23
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:22,990
Morning.

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,500
Morning, everyone!

25
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,510
Morning, Manager Meng!

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,490
Today, I'll tell you

27
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:31,710
some good news.

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,020
The bakery near our
house is offering big discounts.

29
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,650
I've bought you breakfast.

30
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,170
-Liane,
-Thank you, Mr Meng.

31
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,070
take it and share with them.

32
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,900
My pleasure.

33
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,050
Everyone, come here.

34
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,130
Yun Shu.

35
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,630
Take your breakfast.

36
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,560
Lawyer Meng?

37
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,090
Don't go to so much
trouble in the future.

38
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,720
Didn't we make a deal yesterday?

39
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,800
Let's mind our own business.

40
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,570
How come so many good things

41
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,240
have been happening
in our office recently?

42
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:58,420
Dinner,

43
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,700
breakfast.

44
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,050
It's too obvious.

45
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,200
Ten minutes later,

46
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:06,550
come to my office to report on your work.

47
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,060
Okay.

48
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,800
Tell me about it.

49
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,300
How is everything going?
I mean you and Yun Shu.

50
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,720
How do you know that?

51
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,170
It's between Yun Shu and me.

52
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,519
I have known you for over twenty years.

53
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,440
I have never seen you like this.

54
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:33,110
So there must be

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,380
something wrong with you.

56
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,900
Yun Shu.

57
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,430
We are influenced by those close to us!

58
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,870
Since I was together with Yun Lan,

59
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,730
I have been becoming smarter.

60
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,260
What do you mean by that?

61
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,630
I really didn't sleep last night.

62
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,010
Tell me about it.

63
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,320
What happened last night?

64
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:55,300
Yesterday

65
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,580
was Yun Shu's birthday.

66
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,580
How did you feel?

67
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,600
Quite complicated.

68
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,030
It was something

69
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,780
I have never experienced before.

70
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,820
Did you feel a little resistance

71
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,600
and then a little anger?

72
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,500
Before you went to bed,

73
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,650
you felt a little sad.

74
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,630
That must be it.

75
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,090
You have fallen in love with Yun Shu.

76
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,330
Fall in love with Yun Shu?

77
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,360
Yeah.

78
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,020
That's exactly how you
feel when you're in love.

79
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,750
Well...

80
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,060
That's a possibility.

81
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,210
What else could that be?

82
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,280
That is unscientific.

83
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,560
No research

84
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,070
should be complete
without reverse inference,

85
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,450
because it will make the
results obtained of argumentation

86
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,720
more reliable.

87
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,610
I got it.

88
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,580
Say it.

89
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,090
Men's desire to possess.

90
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,250
Male animals' inborn desire to possess.

91
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,590
Yun Shu is your wife.

92
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,450
Since you've been
together for such a long time,

93
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,380
you have long believed
you have already had her.

94
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,620
But now

95
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,150
another male competitor has appeared.

96
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,580
You must be surprised

97
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,620
and even mad.

98
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,130
Then how do you explain "sad".

99
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,550
As for "sad",

100
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,450
maybe you think you may lose the race.

101
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,890
The cooked duck

102
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,690
flies away.

103
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,020
What a shame!

104
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,050
How do you feel?

105
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,250
Last night,

106
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,370
how did Mr Zhang celebrate
your birthday with you?

107
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,390
It was already late

108
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,650
when I got back last night.

109
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,690
It was nothing

110
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,280
compared to my surprise, huh?

111
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,260
No.

112
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,500
Come on! Was there no celebration at all?

113
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,610
Well...

114
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,300
That's not it.

115
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,570
I'm telling you,

116
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,050
Zhang Si Nian

117
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,500
has a high IQ

118
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,650
but his EQ still remains to be improved.

119
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,840
Forget it.

120
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,810
He will

121
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,350
celebrate it sooner or later.

122
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,430
Really?

123
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,140
Yun Shu.

124
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,270
Look at you.

125
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,850
You are overjoyed.

126
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,690
Shouldn't you consider

127
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,690
my feelings more or less?

128
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,659
Sorry!

129
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,000
I didn't mean it.

130
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,050
Okay, okay, okay.

131
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,130
I was just kidding.

132
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,480
But Yun Shu,

133
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:14,690
I want everything

134
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,050
to go back to what it was.

135
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,040
I don't want

136
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,530
you to avoid me on purpose.

137
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,650
Although I am in love with you,

138
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,090
it does not necessarily mean

139
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,370
you have to love me back right away.

140
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,620
When it comes to love,

141
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,240
it would be wonderful if there
is resonance between lovers,

142
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,550
but love can't be compelled.

143
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,630
Do you think so?

144
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,620
Yes.

145
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,130
Actually,

146
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,800
to love someone silently

147
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,170
is also a big pleasure.

148
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,920
Then it's a deal.

149
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,200
You love Mr Zhang secretly.

150
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,800
I love you secretly.

151
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:45,720
No. No.

152
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,550
Mr Meng, that is not what I mean.

153
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,680
I was just kidding.

154
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,320
Enjoy.

155
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:52,290
It's all cool now.

156
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,740
No, Yi Yi.

157
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,820
Are you OK?

158
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:08,900
As for that day,

159
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,930
I didn't mean to hide it.

160
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,040
I just want to...

161
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,080
Shut up!

162
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:14,810
No, I mean...

163
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,460
You are playing the Honour of Kings

164
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,370
without telling me.

165
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,110
Obviously you didn't
want me to play it with you.

166
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,820
No, Yi Yi.

167
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,290
I mean...

168
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,090
Hurry up!

169
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,500
Can't you see someone's coming for me?

170
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,340
I "died" again.

171
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,570
OK

172
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,980
I'll focus on my game.

173
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:33,960
Come on, come on.

174
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:34,440
Someone is coming.

175
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,630
Go, go.

176
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,650
Go to "die"!

177
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:41,920
Want to run?

178
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,150
Look at my flash.

179
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,190
[Gu Xiao]

180
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,130
[You died in battle]

181
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,970
How could it be
possible to die like this?

182
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:49,000
Yi Yi.

183
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,789
Or, you might as well cry it out.

184
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,760
I...

185
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,020
Why do I cry?

186
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,900
I'm so happy.

187
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,289
Or I'll go to meet Gu Xiao right now.

188
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,240
I'll give him a lesson.

189
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,140
Don't...

190
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,260
Lucky for him.

191
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,090
You are not going anywhere!

192
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,810
Stay put!

193
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,950
I don't care about him.

194
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,820

00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,640
Anything of the data
involved in the case at that time

387
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,490
that I felt suspicious

388
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,680
was also annotated.

389
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,790
Lawyer Yun.

390
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,230
Any other instructions?

391
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,470
You've done a good job!

392
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:20,930
It is worthy of encouragement.

393
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,990
What do you want to do?

394
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,660
Oral commendation.

395
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,440
Isn't that a little stingy?

396
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,240
You mustn't mess around.

397
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,160
Here is the company.

398
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,320
I just want to have dinner together.

399
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,420
You think too much.

400
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm going to book a restaurant.

401
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,370
Isn't that Lu Yu?

402
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,320
It's Lu Yu.

403
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,410
I'm crazy about you.

404
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,190
Add me.

405
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,849
I want your signature.

406
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,190
Okay.

407
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,040
Let me take a photo for you.

408
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,250
Let me take a photo for you.

409
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,180
I want to take a photo.

410
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,530
Okay.

411
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,829
Have you taken the photo?

412
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,040
Here.

413
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,329
Come on.

414
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,360
Yun Lan.

415
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,590
Didn't we agree to have dinner together?

416
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,650
Why are you leaving now?

417
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,830
I'm tired.

418
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,530
I’m not feeling well.

419
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,420
Let me see.

420
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,500
It's alright.

421
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,280
I told you again and again,
don't tire yourself out.

422
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,490
You never listened to me.

423
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,580
You even scolded me.

424
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,590
Eat it when it is still hot.

425
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,980
You may go back first.

426
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,350
What's the matter?

427
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,480
Are you feeling unwell?

428
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,020
Let me see

429
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,250
I'm really fine.

430
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,500
You may go home first.

431
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,800
Alright.

432
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,180
Come on.

433
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,450
Remember to eat.

434
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,360
Mr Zhang,

435
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,020
you're back.

436
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,570
I made a lot of delicious food today.

437
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,630
Let's eat together.

438
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,440
I'm tired

439
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,460
today.

440
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,880
I'm going back to my room first.

441
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,650
Mr Zhang

442
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,650
last night.

443
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,300
In fact, I.

444
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:47,290
Mr Zhang.

445
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,200
Is there a power failure in the house?

446
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,550
I think so.

447
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,280
I'll have a look at the switchboard.

448
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,120
Go to the study.

449
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,350
Inside the cupboard drawer,

450
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,000
there should be some candles.

451
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,260
Okay.

452
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,030
Yun Shu.

453
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,040
Have you paid the electricity bill

454
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,280
this month?

455
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,700
Mr Zhang, I'm sorry.

456
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,250
I...

457
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,130
I'll pay for it tomorrow morning.

458
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,320
Mr Zhang.

459
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,040
What's the matter?

460
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,840
Where on earth do you keep the candles?

461
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,440
Which drawer are they in?

462
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,020
Candles should be in

463
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,110
the row near the blackboard.

464
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,010
On the second or

465
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,480
the third layer.

466
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:43,490
Okay.

467
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,270
Yun Shu.

468
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,150
Look it up for yourself.

469
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,440
Okay.

470
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,880
I found it.

471
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,300
I thought you'd forgotten.

472
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,700
The cake has been
sitting in the fridge all day.

473
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,370
I don't know if we can still eat it.

474
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,830
It's very beautiful.

475
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,500
I'm glad you like it.

476
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,280
By the way,

477
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,960
I got you a present.

478
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,600
What is it?

479
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,820
I see that the book you used before

480
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:11,900
is almost full.

481
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,580
So I bought a new one for you.

482
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,890
Do you like them?

483
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,860
Yes, I do.

484
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,160
Sorry!

485
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,900
Why are you apologising?

486
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,480
Last night,

487
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,150
I came back late.

488
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,570
Never mind.

489
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,070
You have your own life.

490
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,380
You have your own
choices and arrangements.

491
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,160
I was late

492
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,820
because of work.

493
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,730
Because of work?

494
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,300
Working with Lawyer Meng, I suppose.

495
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,320
I wanted to send you WeChat
messages on the way back

496
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,670
last night.

497
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,280
I left my phone there.

498
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,770
It was returned to me by Lawyer Meng.

499
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,370
So you and Meng Ran were downstairs

500
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,930
last night because he

501
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,430
wanted to give you your phone?

502
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,300
Were you downstairs yesterday?

503
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,560
You just said that.

504
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,480
Lawyer Meng returned you the phone.

505
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,860
Make a wish!

506
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,500
Or the candle will soon go out.

507
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,240
♫ Turning off the lights
in search of its trace ♫

508
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,810
♫ I walk steadily
on the path beneath my feet ♫

509
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,780
Yun Shu.

510
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,770
Happy birthday!

511
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,590
Thanks.

512
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:10,520
♫ I hear someone asking,
are you still here? ♫

513
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,350
Hello, Lawyer Meng.

514
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,350
Right now?

515
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,370
Okay

516
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,460
I'll go now.

517
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:28,240
Okay.

518
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,350
See you later.

519
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,150
Lawyer Meng?

520
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,100
He told me I had to go
back and work overtime.

521
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,150
I might have to go now.

522
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:37,720
Mr Zhang.

523
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,500
Would you please check the account?

524
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,540
Wait

525
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,470
a minute.

526
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:43,890
Let me give you a ride.

527
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,260
Okay.

528
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,320
Yun Shu.

529
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,150
Have you decided to
work overtime at the park?

530
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,820
Lawyer Meng sent me the location.

531
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,210
That's right here.

532
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:06,690
Otherwise

533
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,620
let me go off and have a look.

534
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,820
Thank you for dropping me off today.

535
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,950
You may go home first.

536
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,560
No, I mean...

537
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,580
Yun Shu.

538
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,520
Our client this time

539
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,800
is very special and mysterious.

540
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:24,810
So.

541
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,750
Just to keep it a secret,

542
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:27,710
I chose here.

543
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,980
I feel like I'm in a spy movie.

544
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,420
Yeah.

545
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,720
Was there anyone following you

546
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,930
when you came?

547
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,090
I guess no.

548
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,600
I'm kidding.

549
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,560
Let's go.

550
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,390
Have you seen this episode?

551
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,160
I haven't.

552
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,450
It has just been updated.

553
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,770
Lawyer Meng?

554
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,380
Working overtime in the park?

555
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,000
Mr Zhang.

556
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,120
I forgot to mention it.

557
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,980
It was Mr Zhang who sent me here today.

558
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,620
Lawyer Meng, please don't use work

559
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,360
as an excuse

560
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,220
to take up Yun Shu's personal time.

561
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,010
Yun Shu.

562
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,040
If you don't like working overtime.

563
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,060
You can just tell me.

564
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,130
That's okay.

565
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,420
No. No.

566
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,850
I didn't mean it.

567
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,260
Mr Zhang.

568
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,500
You don't trust Yun Shu, do you?

569
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,410
Please don't change the subject.

570
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,380
Meng Ran.

571
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,920
I don't trust you.

572
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:23,890
Why?

573
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,300
You always use your work as an excuse

574
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,520
to take up Yun Shu's personal time.

575
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:27,620
I don't believe there is anyone

576
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,840

767
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,120
Professor Zhang.

768
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,220
This is a report sent to you

769
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,290
by Lawyer Meng Ran.

770
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,260
You have a look at it.

771
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,340
Sorry to trouble you.

772
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,310
Thanks.

773
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,360
♫ You're a familiar stranger ♫

774
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,590
♫ Who keeps appearing before me ♫

775
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,790
♫ You're clumsy yet kind ♫

776
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,320
♫ Ringing the bell in my heart ♫

777
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,920
♫ You predict and plan, but you can't
solve the problem called love ♫

778
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,040
♫ Let me tell you, just hold my hand ♫

779
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:02,440
♫ Looking up, I see
the most perfect you ♫

780
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,910
♫ Close your eyes and feel me out,
the plain girl ♫

781
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,280
♫ Time is ticking, too much romance
is is left behind ♫

782
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,400
♫ You're here with me
as time passes us by ♫

783
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:15,090
[Heart rate too fast]

784
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:19,660
[Fall deeply in love]

785
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:27,300
Mr Zhang, I want to see you.

786
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,250
Yun Shu, I want to see you.

787
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,070
♫ You're excessive yet conservative ♫

788
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,140
Miss Shen.

789
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,710
♫ You dislike compromises ♫

790
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,920
Help me reschedule

791
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,120
the meeting this afternoon.

792
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,420
I have something else to do.

793
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,000
♫ You quietly take hold of me ♫

794
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,450
I'll go first.

795
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,670
♫ Only letting out your worries at night ♫

796
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,510
♫ Carefully, you keep
your determination close ♫

797
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,600
♫ I'm running towards you,
please hold my hand ♫

798
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,840
♫ Looking up, I see
the most perfect you ♫

799
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,170
♫ Close your eyes and feel me out,
the plain girl ♫

800
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,160
Yun Shu.

801
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:06,760
♫ Time is ticking, too much romance
is is left behind ♫

802
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,500
Cousin?
