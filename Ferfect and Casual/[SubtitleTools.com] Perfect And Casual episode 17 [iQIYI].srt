[Episode 17]

4
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,470
Yun Shu.

5
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,080
Cousin Huo Qi?

6
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,640
Yun Shu.

7
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,240
I'll explain to you later.

8
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,120
Go to meet someone with me now.

9
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:44,740
Let's go.

10
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,860
Mei.

11
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,200
This is the evidence we found.

12
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,330
All invoices of fake VAT
your husband bought

13
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,030
are here.

14
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,860
Si Nian.

15
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,380
Sorry for interrupting you.

16
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,500
I'm in a hurry.

17
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,720
Please excuse me.

18
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,680
Go ahead.

19
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,820
What are you doing here?

20
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:30,720
Where is Yun Shu?

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,030
Why isn't she in the company?

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,390
Didn't she go to confess to you?

23
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,270
Sorry?

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,580
I waited for her downstairs

25
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,710
for half an hour.

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,480
But I didn't see her
and couldn't contact her.

27
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:39,790
That's impossible.

28
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,080
She left forty minutes ago.

29
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,510
Forty minutes?

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,620
Forty minutes.

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,290
Huo Qi.

32
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,500
I have to call the police.

33
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,470
Don't be hasty.

34
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,040
I know Yun Shu doesn't
want to call the police.

35
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:58,590
But what do you say we do
if we don't call them?

36
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,860
In the surveillance video,

37
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,020
we saw Huo Qi came to find Yun Shu.

38
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,550
It's only been three hours
since they left.

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,330
The police won't make

40
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,240
In addition,

41
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,390
And if you rush to the police,

42
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,480
It's likely to threaten.

43
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,740
Yun Shu's safety

44
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,560
I get everything you just said.

45
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,840
So, what do you propose then?

46
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,020
I think I've seen these two people.

47
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,920
They seem to be Mr Tu's men.

48
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,750
Who is Mr Tu?

49
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,570
Hey, girl.

50
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,540
Have some tea.

51
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,020
Why is he kneeling?

52
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,700
Huo Qi.

53
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,900
Why are you kneeling?

54
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,990
Sit.

55
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,410
Have some tea.

56
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,440
It's okay. Thanks.

57
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,570
I don't often drink tea.

58
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,640
Didn't you bring me to see my uncle?

59
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,790
Who is he?

60
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,630
Where are we?

61
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,970
Everyone calls me Mr Tu.

62
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,810
We

63
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,870
run short-term financial business

64
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,650
in the market.

65
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,260
Your cousin

66
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,950
borrowed from me

67
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,940
a small sum of 500,000 yuan.

68
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,690
According to the contract,

69
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,290
he should pay

70
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,850
the corresponding interest every month.

71
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,030
After the expiration of three months,

72
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,420
he should pay everything together
with the principal amount.

73
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,400
But

74
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,200
your cousin didn't obey the rules.

75
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,330
He didn't pay interest

76
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,500
but went out to travel.

77
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,760
Was it fun?

78
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,060
Was it fun?

79
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,580
I’m not an unreasonable person.

80
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,780
But everyone

81
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,200
should obey the rules.

82
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:58,200
You're right.

83
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,100
All debts

84
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,660
should be paid.

85
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,130
Your cousin brought you here today

86
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,230
because he expects you to help him

87
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,630
clear his debt.

88
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,760
You cheated me out of
more than two million yuan.

89
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,920
You still borrowed
money from a loan shark?

90
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,310
How did you spend the money?

91
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,090
What did you do with it?

92
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,660
You cheated such a lovely cousin.

93
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,760
You're such a scum.

94
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,010
I have nothing to explain.

95
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,730
It's all my fault

96
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,010
for what happened.

97
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,820
Yun Shu.

98
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,200
I just want to tell you I'm sorry

99
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,150
from the bottom of my heart.

100
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,020
I was greedy.

101
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,340
I wanted to make some
easy money in real estate.

102
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,630
So that my parents can
move to live with me early.

103
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,650
But due to real estate
purchase restrictions,

104
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,160
I lost all my money.

105
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,450
I owed a lot of debts.

106
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,560
And I had to make every endeavour
to borrow money to pay.

107
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,650
Yun Shu.

108
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,500
I just wanted to use your money

109
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,150
to speculate in the stock
market to get all money back.

110
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,560
But then the stock prices fell.

111
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,340
So I lost all my money again.

112
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,090
I had no way out.

113
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,440
-So I went to...
-The truth is,

114
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,600
he took the money to Macao

115
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,930
and lost it all.

116
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,990
I was wrong. It was my bad.

117
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,140
That's enough!

118
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,580
You don't have to pay back

119
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,790
the money I gave you.

120
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,450
I'm done dealing with him.

121
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,300
You can deal with him

122
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,320
how you want.

123
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,890
I'm leaving.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,880
Yun Shu.

125
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,480
Yun Shu.

126
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,860
Yun Shu.

127
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,860
Shu.

128
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,060
What will I do if you leave?

129
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,100
You don't have to pay
back the money you owe me.

130
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,810
Deal with your own affairs.

131
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,000
Yun Shu.

132
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,120
Yun Shu, don't go.

133
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,410
Yun Shu.

134
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,280
Don't go.

135
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,250
Help me to pay a small sum,
please?

136
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,360
I know you don't have too much.

137
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,650
But your husband does.

138
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,900
If you two won't save me,

139
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,330
I'll be killed.

140
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,100
How could you hit him?

141
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,890
How could you hit him?

142
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,860
Dude, please.

143
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,420
Stop. Please.

144
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,030
Just do that to me, okay?

145
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,810
Yun Shu, I'm fine.

146
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,700
I despise men

147
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,790
who don't respect women the most.

148
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,680
Right here.

149
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,550
Go.

150
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,720
Does it hurt?

151
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,310
Sorry, Yun Shu.

152
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:01,940
I brought bad luck to you.

153
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:02,930
No.

154
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,020
It's alright

155
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,940
I'm really sorry.

156
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,220
What are you doing?

157
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,420
Stop!

158
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,950
Mr Zhang.

159
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,850
Yun Shu.

160
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,210
Are you injured?

161
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,860
I'm fine.

162
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,920
She's fine.

163
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,270
It's me who's hurt.

164
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,430
This is illegal imprisonment, okay?

165
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,140
Don't talk nonsense.

166
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,930
We didn't stop this girl from leaving.

167
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,530
It's her cousin.

168
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,260
It's her cousin

169
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,910
who is reluctant to let her go.

170
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,090
Wait for me for a moment.

171
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,070
You must be

172
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,810
Yun Shu's husband, right?

173
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,680
Everybody calls me Mr Tu.

174
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,690
How should I address you?

175
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,780
People call me Mr Zhang.

176
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,720
Mr Zhang.

177
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,390
What do you teach?

178
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,650
Statistics.

179
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,360
We're both teachers.

180
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Nice to meet you.

181
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,860
What do you teach?

182
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,360
Social Science.

183
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,930
Yun Shu, let's go.

184
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,130
Wait.

185
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,360
Wait a minute. Things
haven't been made clear yet.

186
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,660
Is it inappropriate

187
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,790
for you to leave, no?

188
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,230
Don't you know the business
you're running?

189
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,060
Private lending with annual
interest rate exceeding 15 percent

190
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,340
is illegal.

191
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,790
I can call the police now.

192
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,290
Who are you?

193
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,860
I'm Yun Shu's lawyer.

194
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,100
Talk to me

195
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,870
about his problems.

196
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,310
Lawyer?

197
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,540
That's good.

198
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,620
My peer.

199
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,660
You.

200
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,030
Bring Huo Qi's loan contract here

201
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,450
to let the lawyer help us improve it.

202
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,590
What's wrong with you?

203
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,800
You didn't answer my calls.

204
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,940
Have you eaten?

205
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,260
I can take you for barbecue.

206
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,700
No, thanks.

207
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,540
I'm a little tired.

208
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,500
Honey.

209
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,150
What's wrong with you recently?

210
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,710
Every time I ask you
out, you'd say you're tired.

211
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,440
Are deliberately avoiding me?

212
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,490
I've been too busy at work recently.

213
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,650
Maybe another day.

214
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,320
Honey, what's wrong?

215
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,660
I haven't...

216
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,010
I haven't made any mistakes recently.

217
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,010
Are you going to push me for the truth?

218
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:24,860
Yes.

219
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,820
Lu Yu.

220
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,820
I kind of like you indeed.

221
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,790
But I'm not prepared to
fall in love with a celebrity.

222
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,250
Acting is my job.

223
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,790
Just like you're a lawyer.

224
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,050
What difference does it make?

225
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,450
The difference is that
I'm an ordinary person.

226
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,790
I won't be surrounded by people.

227
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,750
I don't have to put on disguises.

228
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,480
-People won't give...
-Give what?

229
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,270
If you don't like it, I'll take it off.

230
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,030
Lu Yu, that's not what I mean.

231
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,000
What do you mean?

232
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,810
Hello, Mr Han.

233
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,100
No problem.

234
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,940
Send me the address.

235
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,300
Where are you going?

236
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,650
To work.

237
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:03,940
Let me send you there.

238
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,750
You don't have to.
I can go myself.

239
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,170
The contract is fine.

240
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,930
No illegal terms.

241
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,640
The annual interest rate of this contract
is 35%.

242
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,200
Although it exceeds the
stipulated 24% by law,

243
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,850
the range from 24% to 35%

244
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,130
belongs to natural lending
range according to the law.

245
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,550
The court neither
supports it, but it isn't illegal.

246
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,170
Usury is illegal in private lending.

247
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,250
But the identification of usury

248
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,700
lies in whether the
lender includes interest

249
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,310
in principal compound interest.

250
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,480
And this contract clearly states

251
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,250
the interest shall not be included
in principal compound interest.

252
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,530
So this contract is valid

253
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,960
legally.

254
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,730
That's not true.

255
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,270
Then I just borrowed it
for more than half a year.

256
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,560
Why should I pay back
more than one million?

257
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,910
Because you’re stupid.

258
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,450
They made a security service contract

259
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,100
according to the extra interest.

260
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,440
325,000 yuan of the interest

261
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,940
is made as security service fee.

262
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,960
The last page of the contract

263
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,280
includes the video evidence
of their security services

264
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,470
during his gambling in Macao.

265
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,520
So this contract
is also valid legally.

266
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,130
I cannot believe

267
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,990
you actually signed it.

268
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,180
A real insider.

269
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,490
You're really professional.

270
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,520
Yun Shu.

271
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,980
What shall I do

272
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,770
in this situation?

273
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,700
Is there any other way?

274
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,910
Mr Tu.

275
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,160
There's nothing wrong with the contract.

276
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,030
But can I use the whiteboard?

277
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,510
Sure.

278
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,260
It's my honour

279
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,430
to have dinner with Miss Yun Lan.

280
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,160
You flatter me.

281
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,630
Mr Han, may I ask
if you have anything urgent?

282
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,600
No.

283
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,260
I just want to thank Miss Yun Lan

284
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,260
for your hard work

285
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,970
on the recent merger
of our company.

286
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,080
Now our company

287
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,180
is about to sign the contract.

288
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,290
So I want

289
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,600
to thank

290
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,700
Miss Yun Lan properly.

291
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,040
Let me take a picture for you.

292
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,210
Let me do it...

293
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,260
[Give my husband, Lu Yu, back!]

294
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,060
Miss Yun Lan?

295
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,510
Sorry, Mr Han.

296
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,280
What did you just say?

297
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,480
I said

298
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,700
I have a private activity next week.

299
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,530
And I want to invite you to join me.

300
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,860
Would you like to?

301
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,210
Miss Yun Lan,

302
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,710
you seem a little absent-minded today.

303
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,240
Does the food taste bad?

304
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,370
No.

305
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,660
No problem.

306
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:01,880
Mr Han.

307
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,580
Let me know when you set the time.

308
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,920
I'll pick you up myself then.

309
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,440
Mr Tu, as a businessman,

310
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,080
you must attach importance to

311
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,630
"harmony brings wealth", right?

312
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,440
Cut to the chase.

313
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,570
Okay.

314
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,410
Huo Qi is temporarily unable to repay

315
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,060
the one million yuan.

316
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,960
You can freeze his account

317
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,710
through civil proceedings.

318
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,070
But in this case,

319
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,830
you'll get nothing in the short term.

320
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,470
Your expected revenue value

321
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,100
will be infinitely close to zero.

322
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,910
But don't forget

323
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,520
we got a variety of dunning methods.

324
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,790
If you're sure to choose those methods,

325
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,910
we won't just stay idle.

326
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,410
We'll go to the police.

327
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,770
And the police will be
involved in the investigation.

328
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,670
Or

329
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,620
we'll report you to the
China Banking Regulatory Commission.

330
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,820
They will surely investigate the matter.

331
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,900
What do you want to say?

332
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,030
According to your business model,

333
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,990
10 million will reap a daily profit

334
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,920
of 4,600 yuan.

335
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,680
Whether we go to the police,

336
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,280
or report to the CBRC and
other relevant departments,

337
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,220
your loss

338
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,340
will exceed the income from his loan

339
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,230
as long as you cooperate with
the investigation for ten days.

340
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,030
So

341
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,310
Mr Zhang, do you
want to repudiate a debt?

342
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,380
Of course not.

343
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,120
It is only right to pay one's debt.

344
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,310
But I suggest a compromise.

345
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,550
I'll pay, on Huo Qi's behalf,

346
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,710
the normal principal
and interest of the debt

347
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,980
of 587,500 yuan.

348
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,450
Meanwhile, you will give up
the 412,500 yuan,

349
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,200
which is compound interest creditors get.

350
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,560
Under such circumstances,

351
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,760
you can get

352
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,890
the normal principal and
interest of 587,500 yuan.

353
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,230
According to your business model,

354
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,220
the normal interest of only 35%

355
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,840
can make you

356
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,810
yield a normal principal and interest

357
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,870
of 998,700 yuan within 24 months.

358
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,450
Go on.

359
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,800
As a practitioners in
the financial industry,

360
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,440
I think Mr Tu

361
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,070
must know about Soros' words.

362
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,120
Taking risk

363
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,430
is above reproach,

364
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,440
but...

365
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,770
But you can't

366
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:25,550
put all your eggs in one basket,

367
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:26,710
right?

368
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,970
That's right.

369
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,619
I have always respected cultured people.

370
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,740
Okay,

371
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,530
we'll do as you said.

372
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:34,580
You are welcome.

373
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,940
Please give me an account number

374
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,710
and you'll receive the money

375
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,380
by 12 noon tomorrow.

376
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,590
You're quite frank.

377
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,670
If you can trust me,

378
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,050
then I will

379
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,140
be taking Huo Qi with me.

380
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,520
Sure.

381
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,800
We're friends now.

382
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,660
Don't worry. It's okay.

383
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,740
How can it be okay?

384
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,340
In this case, it's never okay.

385
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,670
Mr Zhang.

386
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,880
I was wrong.

387
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,600
I'm sorry.

388
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,170
I really don't know
what you were thinking.

389
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,270
How could you get into his car
so casually?

390
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,260
Because he mentioned uncle at that time.

391
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,290
So I...

392
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,730
Then why didn't you answer my phone?

393
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,500
At that time, I didn't have my phone.

394
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,300
Mr Zhang.

395
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,050
It will never happen again.

396
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,470
Next time?

397
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,500
Si Nian.

398
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,070
You were so worried and anxious

399
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,740
when you tried to find her just now.

400
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,920
Now you've found her,

401
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,170
why are you angry?

402
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,280
I just hope

403
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,350
she can learn from this.

404
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,590
Yes, I've learned my lesson.
Absolutely.

405
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,800
Get in the car.

406
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:53,770
Let's go home.

407
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:05,810
It's alright.

408
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,080
I can go by myself.

409
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,700
Tu,

410
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,330
how could you let them go?

411
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,300
That's not your style.

412
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,160
I can only say

413
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,310
you don't know my style.

414
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,100
We don't deserve money

415
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,510
from the people of this realm.

416
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,500
What are you doing with a knife?

417
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,350
Come on.

418
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,680
What are you doing?

419
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,880
I'm going to get revenge
on that scum!

420
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,340
Let go.

421
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,900
Let me go. Now!

422
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,640
What's the use of going to him now?

423
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,080
You should just let it go.

424
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:14,980
Look at yourself.

425
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,740
You look terrible.

426
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,760
It's not that I can't let go.

427
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,960
I'm bitter!

428
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,040
So you want to go?

429
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,780
I'll go on your behalf.

430
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,740
Wait.

431
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,950
I won’t go.

432
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,320
Wait, I won't go.

433
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,290
I won't go. So you can't go either.

434
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,330
Gu Xiao is not good for you.

435
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,970
You can do better.

436
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,220
You have me...

437
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,250
I mean

438
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,170
I can help you to find a better man.

439
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,300
What kind of man do you want?

440
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,350
I'll help you.

441
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,870
I want a boyfriend

442
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,700
who comforts me like friends do

443
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,830
when I'm sad,

444
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,620
take care of me

445
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,170
like my father does when
I'm feeling helpless

446
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,700
and protect me

447
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,870
like a brother does when I'm bullied.

448
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,460
Can you find one like that?

449
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,980
I can definitely help you find

450
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,140
a man who really loves you.

451
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,080
Thank you, Mr Han.

452
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,570
We're friends.

453
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,860
You don't have to say that.

454
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,710
I'll walk you up.

455
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:42,970
You don't have to.

456
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,220
I can go by myself.

457
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,320
Who was that?

458
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,660
Mr Han from Xin Da company.

459
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,730
I was wondering why
he looked so familiar.

460
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,190
Why haven't you gone back yet?

461
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,020
I'm waiting for you.

462
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,210
I'm not in the mood today.

463
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,930
You might as well go home.

464
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,010
Yun Lan.

465
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,600
That's enough.

466
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,010
I'm really leaving if you keep doing this.

467
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,390
Lu Yu.

468
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,330
-Yes?
-We are from different walks of life.

469
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,780
It's an unavoidable problem
between you and me.

470
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,790
Think it over when you go back.

471
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,590
What's going on?

472
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,220
Tell me,

473
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,820
why did you bring me here?

474
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,750
I... I said I'd find you
a boyfriend, right?

475
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,830
Are you really going to
find one on the street?

476
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,150
What's wrong with it?

477
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,980
It's rare to find a three-legged toad

478
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,280
but easy to find a two-legged man.

479
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,260
Alright.

480
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,810
I'll help you find a girlfriend today.

481
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,850
Okay.

482
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,270
Let's help each other.

483
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,480
How about this one wearing a shirt?

484
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,150
Oh, come on.

485
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,410
Just one glance

486
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,990
and I can tell he's the worst.

487
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,520
But the girl next to him is not bad.

488
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,790
She looks refined.

489
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,990
Refined?

490
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,700
She's revealing too much
in that short skirt.

491
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,310
It's not that bad.

492
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,390
I think it's fine.

493
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,420
Why is it so difficult

494
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,260
to find a good man?

495
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,740
It's the same case with

496
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,310
finding a good woman.

497
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,140
How about

498
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,150
we go to a karaoke for entertainment?

499
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,060
Does it still hurt?

500
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,450
No.

501
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,890
Are you not finished?

502
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,950
Keep still.

503
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,340
When I was a kid,

504
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,330
my sister and I got injured often.

505
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,560
So,

506
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,740
I’m very good

507
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,500
at treating wounds.

508
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,430
Yun Shu.

509
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,390
There's something I want to tell you.

510
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,780
[Meng Ran]

511
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,830
I'll answer it later.

512
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,720
Hello, Mr Meng.

513
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,970
Si Nian and I are fine.

514
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,240
Thank you for your help today.

515
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,200
Yun Shu.

516
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,930

This is a little awkward.

Right.

531
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,910

Let's have breakfast.

549
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:17,870
Morning.

550
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,200
Morning.

551
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,360
Mr Zhang.

552
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,720
Why are you...

553
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,680
I can enjoy the better scenery from here.

554
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:49,810
And

555
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,050
the field of vision will be wider.

556
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,210
Can I?

557
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,220
Left half and right half.

558
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,490
Why do we observe time
for the use of bathroom?

559
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,080
Am I being taken in or held custody?

560
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,330
Mr Zhang.

561
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,610
Excuse me, I need the bathroom.

562
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,190
The hours of use is on the door.

563
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,760
[Oh, my gosh.]

564
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,470
[It's so sweet.]

565
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,020
[But, Yun Shu,]

566
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,230
[from today on,]

567
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,350
[I don't need to watch
these love dramas anymore.]

568
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,880
[Because Mr Zhang and you]

569
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:12,240
[will have your own sweet,
love drama.

570
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,310
You two made up again?

571
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,020
Come on.

572
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,790
What's going on with you two?

573
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,010
You got back together

574
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,760
or you unilaterally made the worst choice?

575
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,770
I wasn't in good mood

576
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,450
and wanted him to drink with me.

577
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,860
But the result was that

578
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,270
we both got in the mood.

579
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,460
So what are you two going to do now?

580
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,530
I think

581
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,470
the man

582
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,670
who cares about me most

583
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,430
is still Lin Nuo after so many years.

584
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,120
Yi Yi,

585
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,310
you need to know

586
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,600
that we like a person

587
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,300
because he is the man.

588
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,500
not he cares about us most.

589
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,870
I don't know what I'm thinking either.

590
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,150
I think I like him.

591
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,780
But we’ve been friends for two years.

592
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,810
I'm really not used
to the new relationship.

593
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,890
Anyway.

594
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,570
You must think it over

595
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,510
and don't hurt Lin Nuo.

596
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,860
Okay. Don't talk about me.

597
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,260
Tell me about your story.

598
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,000
How was it going

599
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,240
between Professor Zhang and you?

600
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,070
When I got up

601
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,440
this morning. I set an alarm clock.

602
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,740
I brushed my teeth

603
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,260
and applied a new lipstick

604
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,510
I wanted to stand in
front of Professor Zhang

605
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,300
and let him give me a morning kiss.

606
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,870
Do you know what happened?

607
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,860
What?

608
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,100
Mr Zhang.

609
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,350
Morning.

610
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,990
Morning.

611
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,020
Your bag.

612
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,840
Don't you go to work at ten o'clock?

613
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,160
Why did you get up so early?

614
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,780
I couldn't sleep.

615
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,210
Then read a book.

616
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,460
It's efficient for you
to read during the day.

617
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,890
Your lips are a little red.

618
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,110
Does it look good?

619
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,180
Did you get excessive internal heat?

620
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,700
There’s bitter chrysanthemum
in the cupboard.

621
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,900
Infuse it with hot water.

622
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,030
And you should drink more water.

623
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,090
And this.

624
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,210
It works well.

625
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,680
Drink more bitter chrysanthemum tea.

626
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,870
I'm going to work.

627
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,030
Tell me why a man goes out
with a lipstick?

628
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,550
I was so angry.

629
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,060
The cute Professor Zhang

630
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,950
is really an indifferent,

631
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,910
mysterious and strong-minded straight man
as people say.

632
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,120
Yi Yi.

633
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,700
When can the sweet love story in TV series

634
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:43,150
come to me?

635
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,420
I'm still doubting

636
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,980
if the kiss last night

637
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,900
was for real or not.

638
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,900
In order to deal with
such straight man,

639
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,880
we must

640
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,420
take the initiative to grab him.
