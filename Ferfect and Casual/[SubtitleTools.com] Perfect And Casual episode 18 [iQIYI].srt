[Episode 18]

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,060
Is this love now?

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,760
Do I ask too much?

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,490
Or

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,720
is Mr Zhang too reserved?

8
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,810
Will I be too unemotional?

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,440
Lu Yu also said

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,410
we can't deal with love

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,960
like we do business.

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,620
Yun Shu.

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:41,950
I was wondering

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,300
if we should add

15
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,160
a supplementary clause?

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,440
In the previous clauses,

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,790
the one.

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,760
"Falling in love with each
other shall not be allowed"

19
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,670
seems inappropriate for

20
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,050
our relationship now.

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,280
Then I'll revise it now.

22
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,490
Okay.

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,210
I was thinking,

24
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,330
since we are a couple,

25
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:10,850
and you like me

26
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,810
and I like you,

27
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,590
why don't we

28
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,630
cut all the

29
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,460
cumbersome procedures?

30
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,640
Do you agree?

31
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,460
How about

32
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,130
we sleep together tonight?

33
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,170
Mr Zhang.

34
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,090
I...

35
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,060
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,380
You...

37
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,360
What did

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,650
you say?

39
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,880
I said

40
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,930
since we are a couple,

41
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:37,790
it's okay for us

42
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,760
to sleep together,

43
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,079
right?

44
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,440
No problem.

45
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,280
You can bring "Wu Qian"

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,520
to sleep with us.

47
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,610
Then.

48
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:51,650
I...

49
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,770
I'll change the sheets.

50
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,620
How about.

51
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,080
Let's sleep.

52
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,200
Okay.

53
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,600
You...

54
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,250
What's your favourite position?

55
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,350
I mean

56
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,000
your sleeping position.

57
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,810
I prefer to sleep on my side.

58
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,280
Mr Zhang.

59
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,930
What position

60
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,370
do you prefer?

61
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,260
I also like to

62
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,340
sleep on my side.

63
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,610
Mr Zhang.

64
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,570
The quilt is gone!

65
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,840
Sorry.

66
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,330
How about.

67
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,090
Let's get closer.

68
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,760
So we can share the quilt.

69
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,890
Is this better?

70
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,910
Is it too superficial for us

71
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,680
to sleep like this?

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,920
How about

73
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,880
I'll sleep with you in my arms, okay?

74
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,850
Good night.

75
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,370
Good night.

76
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,920
Mr Zhang.

77
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,520
Mr Zhang.

78
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,850
Mr Zhang.

79
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,390
I can't sleep

80
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,930
if you continue holding me like this.

81
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,720
Mr Zhang.

82
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,159
You're up early.

83
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,260
Did you sleep well last night?

84
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,300
Yes.

85
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,260
You...

86
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,090
You don't look so good.

87
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,530
Maybe I can only sleep well in my bed.

88
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,960
Mr Zhang.

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,810
Does the relationship

90
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,720
develop too fast?

91
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,110
How about.

92
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,450
Let's slow it down.

93
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,120
I'll look into it.

94
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,090
Okay.

95
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,600
Turns out

96
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,390
it was only a sleeping position.

97
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,169
We may as well sleep back to back.

98
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,090
At least I could get some sleep.

99
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,450
Miss Shen,

100
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,210
I’ve encountered a
difficult problem recently

101
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,800
and I want to ask you for advice.

102
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:02,660
Tell me.

103
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,560
What can possibly

104
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,530
be troubling you?

105
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,000
Simply,

106
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,190
someone you like

107
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
suddenly tells you

108
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,280
that you have a fast-going

109
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,230
relationship.

110
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,500
What does this mean?

111
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,380
Does it mean

112
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,470
we're not suitable for each other and

113
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,500
or

114
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,220
she wants to break up?

115
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,800
Most relationships

116
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:18,620
need

117
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,170
to develop step by step.

118
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:20,820
If any one step

119
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,080
were missing,

120
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:22,920
the relationship

121
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,200
would make the people involved

122
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,330
feel unsafe.

123
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,970
I'm still quite confused.

124
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:28,740
Then.

125
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,210
What on earth should I do?

126
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,620
For example, you should go to dinner

127
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,410
and watch movies

128
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,030
or date with each other.

129
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,900
You should spend

130
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,260
more time with each other.

131
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,720
Once you've spent some time together,

132
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,700
you'll know whether

133
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,410
you're suitable for each other.

134
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,170
I really ignored these aspects.

135
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:45,950
Yun Shu.

136
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,940
It's almost noon.

137
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:47,910
Just go for lunch.

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,590
You go first

139
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,780
I'll follow later.

140
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,200
Alright.

141
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,350
Then I won't wait for you.

142
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,320
Okay,

143
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,430
Lawyer Guan.

144
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,090
Come on, let's have lunch together.

145
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,120
You can draw

146
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,720
Mei.

147
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,880
Can I have a look?

148
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,970
I just

149
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,240
draw for fun.

150
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,530
Yun Shu,

151
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,010
do you keep a diary in comics?

152
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,850
My dad taught me this when I was a kid.

153
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,120
And I have the habit

154
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,400
when I grow up.

155
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,290
Nice.

156
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,030
You're as good as

157
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,410
many of our studio's

158
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,570

Mei.

160
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,360
Are you trying to poach her?

161
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,350
Lawyer Meng,

162
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,840
you reminded me.

163
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,440
Yun Shu,

164
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,420
are you interested

165
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,920
in becoming a professional artist?

166
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,040
It won't happen.

167
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,180
Yun Shu is our star.

168
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,210
All the more reason for me to poach her.

169
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,130
I'll have to think about

170
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,930
the terms under which

171
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,020
I'm willing to let Yun Shu go.

172
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:16,500
All right.

173
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,270
Please

174
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,120
stop making fun of me.

175
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,100
All right.

176
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,360
Don't joke.

177
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,430
Let's talk in the office.

178
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,400
Okay,

179
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,720
See me soon.

180
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,870
Well?

181
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,050
Last night,

182
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,080
was Zhang Si Nian angry
when you went back?

183
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,010
Not bad.

184
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,780
Looks like Mr Zhang
is finally enlightened.

185
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,860
Congratulations.

186
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:47,970
Lawyer Meng.

187
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,360
Thank you.

188
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,880
For what?

189
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,720
If you really want to thank me,

190
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,880
break up with him.

191
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,560
I'm kidding.

Hello,

Mr Zhang.

196
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,600
Hello, Yun Shu.

197
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,410
Do you have spare time

198
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,380
after work?

199
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,120
Yes, I have.

200
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,280
I'll take you to a cinema tonight.

201
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,160
OK

202
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,280
Well

203
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,570
I'll pick you up

204
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,530
when you're off work.

205
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,130
OK

206
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,810
See you then.

207
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:45,240
Yes, yes.

208
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,200
Six, seven.

209
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,460
It's about to start.

210
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,210
How do you feel?

211
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,450
Did you sleep well?

212
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,960
Just now,

213
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,950
Mr Zhou

214
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,830
called me,

215
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,790
so...

216
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,340
Did you sleep well?

217
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,320
Is that satisfactory?

218
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,720
At what?

219
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,240
This morning,

220
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,260
you said that our love develops too fast.

221
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,530
So I asked Miss Shen for advice.

222
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,750
So.

223
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,770
So that's why you took
me to watch movies?

224
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,210
We got married before we started dating.

225
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,880
So I want

226
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,430
to make it up to you.

227
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,570
I'm

228
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,840
old-fashioned

229
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,280
and not interesting.

230
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,160
But one thing I am sure of is

231
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,610
I really like you.

232
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,170
So I hope

233
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:57,950
we can

234
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,400
get to know each other more.

235
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,810
I don't know

236
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,240
much about love.

237
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,450
But I can learn.

238
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,290
After all, I have quite

239
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,800
a learning ability.

240
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,089
And I'm willing to make some changes

241
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,079
for you.

242
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:21,109
♫ Turning off the lights
in search of its trace ♫

243
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:26,690
♫ I walk steadily
on the path beneath my feet ♫

244
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,250
Mr Zhang.

245
00:15:25,609 --> 00:15:26,880
You've learned a lot already.

246
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:33,070
♫ I hear someone asking,
are you still here? ♫

247
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,380
Let's go.

248
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:39,390
♫ The kind person replies,
I've always been here ♫

249
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,250
Mr Zhang.

250
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,190
Can I sleep

251
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,610
in my own room tonight?

252
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,780
Of course.

253
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,410
The process of love,

254
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,000
I know it.

255
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,980
Then.

256
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,520
Good night.

257
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:02,810
Good night.

258
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,000
Should I grasp it like this?

259
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,330
How is it going?

260
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,650
All right.

261
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:43,870
How about

262
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,740
I'll drive you to work

263
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,180
when you finish changing clothes?

264
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,520
No, thanks.

265
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,650
I can go to the company
again this afternoon.

266
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:51,890
All right.

267
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,130
Yun Shu.

268
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,480
Wait for me at home.

269
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,030
♫ You're a familiar stranger ♫

270
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,470
♫ Who keeps appearing before me ♫

271
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,670
♫ You're clumsy yet kind ♫

272
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,190
♫ Ringing the bell in my heart ♫

273
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,660
♫ You predict and plan, but you can't
solve the problem called love ♫

274
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:21,790
Come on.

275
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,800
I'm done.

276
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,490
♫ Let me tell you, just hold my hand ♫

277
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,320
Coming, coming.

278
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,480
Look at this.

279
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,060
It's started.

280
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:31,390
Okay,

281
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,270
Coming, coming.

282
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,270
I'm in a team fight.

283
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,400
Hold on.

284
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,990
I told you to stop
playing half an hour ago.

285
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,670
Then you pause it first.

286
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,890
-Wait for a while.
-For how long?

287
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,130
I’ve been waiting for
half an hour.

288
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,090
Soon.

289
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
Okay, okay.

290
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,690
I'll watch it with you.

291
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,610
[This game started with a pretty house.]

292
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,030
Lin Nuo.

293
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,210
Let me finish,

294
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:10,720
okay?

295
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,390
If I quit now,

296
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,220
my teammate will lose.

297
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,190
Do you know that?

298
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,890
Sorry, Yi Yi.

299
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,040
I shouldn't be angry with you.

300
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,610
You never yelled at me

301
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,990
when we used to be friends.

302
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,610
When we were friends,

303
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,200
you didn't stop me from playing games.

304
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,560
Then let's continue to be friends.

305
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,680
Okay, okay.

306
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,970
I know I was wrong.

307
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:34,870
It was agreed that

308
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
I should yield to you.

309
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,450
Don't make me use ultimate skill.

310
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,210
All right

311
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,420
I'm not angry anymore.

312
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,610
Let's watch movies.

313
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:54,880
Yun Shu.

314
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:55,770
You're still working

315
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,390
Mei.

316
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,550
Why are you here so early?

317
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,650
Is it just

318
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,730
four o'clock now?

319
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,390
I came to you specially in advance.

320
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,410
For what?

321
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,510
Here's our studio's recruitment notice.

322
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,320
There’ll be a centralized
interview in a week.

323
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,560
Would you like to try it?

324
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,190
[Hiring]

325
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,940
Recruitment season.

326
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,820
Comic master?

327
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,040
But I am an amateur.

328
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,110
Maybe I can't.

329
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,560
Think it over.

330
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,770
If you can earn money

331
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,730
through hobbies,

332
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,370
it's also a good choice.

333
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,510
Thank you, Mei.

334
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,530
[There were a few things I was game
for you never asked.]

335
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,620
[Like?]

336
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,580
[Eating ants.]

337
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,180
[Insulting the unemployed.]

338
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,690
[Loving you like crazy.]

339
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,810
What's wrong with you?

340
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,750
It's alright.

341
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,070
It's just so touching.

342
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,610
What's the matter?

343
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,240
No.

344
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,580
It's alright.

345
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,830
It's just so sudden.

346
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,830
I'm still immersed in

347
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,080
the plot of the movie.

348
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,920
I seem to have lost my contact lenses.

349
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,680
I'll get it.

350
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,840
Go and get it.

351
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,880
Yi Yi.

352
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,430
Can we talk?

353
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:35,920
Hi

354
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,100
sis.

355
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,590
Why is Mr Zhang...

356
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,950
We came here

357
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,490
to tell you something.

358
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,200
Yeah.

359
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,200
Cousin.

360
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,440
You found him?

361
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,560
Huo Qi.

362
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:48,530
Come in.

363
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,430
Yun Lan.

364
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,850
It's been a while!

365
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,200
Hi.

366
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,710
How dare you come to see us?

367
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,360
I thought I'd never see you anymore

368
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,320
in my life.

369
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,330
I'm here

370
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,240
to admit my mistake.

371
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,250
Mei.

372
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:17,880
Take a break.

373
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,840
I'll handle this.

374
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,890
Did you make Yun Lan angry?

375
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,020
How come?

376
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,540
I just think you're too tired

377
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,520
and want you to have a rest.

378
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,730
Yu.

379
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,420
You're so good at coaxing girls.

380
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,090
You brought Yun Shu

381
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,010
to the usury's office?

382
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,890
No.

383
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:38,670
I have to call the police.

384
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,630
Yun Lan.

385
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,240
I was wrong.

386
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,000
I really was wrong.

387
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,120
I promise

388
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:46,980
it won't

389
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,260
happen again.

390
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,080
I promise.

391
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,170
You really don't know how
dangerous it was that day.

392
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,080
If the brother-in-law
hadn't paid debt for me,

393
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,130
I really don't know

394
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:55,920
what Mr Tu would do to me.

395
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:56,890
Maybe...

396
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,130
I'm really scared

397
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,890
I'll never dare to do that again.

398
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,000
Yun Lan.

399
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,570
I can only pay back

400
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,110
the money I owe you little by little.

401
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,030
This is the repayment plan

402
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,090
guarantee I wrote.

403
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,120
I don't need it.

404
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,320
Men like you

405
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,970
never remember
unless you suffer a little.

406
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,720
Yun Lan, let me explain.

407
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,360
Can you give me another chance?

408
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,480
One last chance.

409
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,120
I've learned my lesson, seriously.

410
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,440
Besides...

411
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,520
Besides, my brother-in-law got me a job.

412
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,100
I can go to work soon.

413
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,290
I swear

414
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,440
from now on,

415
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,860
I will work honestly

416
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,950
and get my act together.

417
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,160
I'll make more money

418
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,760
to pay off my debts as soon as possible.

419
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,130
I'm not Yun Shu.

420
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:37,790
I don't believe

421
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,250
anything you said.

422
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,670
Don't be too harsh.

423
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,790
He admitted his mistakes.

424
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,270
You should let it go.

425
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,220
Can you change your

426
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,190
bad temper?

427
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,040
Do you understand what happened to us?

428
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,260
Do you know what he has done?

429
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,070
You don't know anything.

430
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,610
You're not qualified to
express your opinion here.

431
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,400
Although I don't know
about his wrongdoings,

432
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,470
I know your temper.

433
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,760
You always show no mercy
to others when you're in the right.

434
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,480
Since he has apologised

435
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,640
so sincerely,

436
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,050
can't you give him a chance?

437
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,050
This is my family's business,

438
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:01,830
not yours.

439
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,770
Get out.

440
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,770
Not my business?

441
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,220
I'm your boyfriend.

442
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,880
Your family business is also mine.

443
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,250
Brother-in-law.

444
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,690
Thank you.

445
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:13,820
Cousin,

446
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,360
I hope you can take care of yourself.

447
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,230
According to Yun Lan's temper,

448
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,660
she won't forgive you
for the second time.

449
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,010
Why don't you go?

450
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,650
Didn't you say you’d make money?

451
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,650
Why are you still here?

452
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,480
Thank you all.

453
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,330
Go back first.

454
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,510
I have work to do.

455
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:36,430
Hi.

456
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,400
All right.

457
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,530
Let's go back.

458
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,500
You go on with your work.

459
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,170
By the way,

460
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:42,910
Huo Qi just said

461
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:43,870
the house where Yun Shu lived before

462
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
will be rented out.

463
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,050
He has something there.

464
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,050
Help him with it.

465
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,710
No problem.

466
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,060
I want to go too

467
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:50,790
but

468
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,340
I have to work overtime this afternoon.

469
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,290
That's okay.

470
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,690
I can do that by myself.

471
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,280
Let's go.

472
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,690
Okay, sister, we're leaving.

473
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,160
Yun Lan, I...

474
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,500
Today's the day

475
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,220
my sister goes abroad to study.

476
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,510
From now on,

477
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,640
I'm all on my own.

478
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,360
Although I feel a little scared

479
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,670
and nervous,

480
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,190
but you can't.

481
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,210
That's okay.

482
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,230
Yun Shu,

483
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,470
you can do it.

484
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,790
Believe in yourself.

485
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:03,900
Fight on!

486
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,110
I have friends.

487
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,870
Our threesome was given

488
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,120
resounding nicknames.

489
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:09,960
Casual.

490
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,760
Love brain.

491
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:11,840
Copycat.

492
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,730
Although it's not very nice,

493
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,350
we don't care.

494
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,080
In a word,

495
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,450
they're basically okay.

496
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,840
Lin finally caught up with Yi Yi.

497
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,150
When I see them immersed in sweet love,

498
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,170
I feel happy and upset at the same time.

499
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,720
Where's

500
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,370
my love?

501
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,510
Everyone says college life isn't complete

502
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,840
without a romantic relationship.

503
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,930
I'm about to graduate.

504
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,780
Mr Right

505
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,410
please show up.

506
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,840
I hope I can find

507
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,720
an ideal job

508
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,410
and a generous boyfriend

509
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,120
after graduation.

510
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,280
Petty girl.

511
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,840
He can cook a good dish

512
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,480
and it's best for
him to have little talents.

513
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,390
He'll be gentle with me

514
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,920
and always amaze me with surprise.

515
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,670
Whenever I'm tired from work,

516
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,210
he’ll say to me,

517
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,570
"I can support you."

518
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,400
Sometimes he seems like a superman.

519
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,880
He'll show up in time

520
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,660
when I need him.

521
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,000
Twenty-four mate selection criteria.

522
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,040
If I look handsome,

523
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,930
I'm qualified up to 16 of the criteria.

524
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,560
Stop dreaming.

525
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,360
What a silly girl.

526
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,440
With your ordinary looks

527
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,030
and vague character,

528
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,010
nobody will like you.

529
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,520
I like you.

530
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,080
What can I do for you?

531
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,530
Just chit-chat.

532
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,970
I want to chat with you.

533
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,040
What do you think Yun Lan meant

534
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,440
by "we're of the different kind"?

535
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,600
She isn't human

536
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:03,920
or I'm not?

537
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,200
I think what she said

538
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,490
is reasonable.

539
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,610
Whose side are you on?

540
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,330
Who is your brother?

541
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,000
I'm on the side of logic.

542
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,360
I'm talking about Yun Lan here.

543
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,050
Why are you talking about logic?

544
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,080
Who is it?

545
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,840
You are a public figure.

546
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,910
You can always

547
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,540
encounter various things

548
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,830
in life.

549
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,200
You get used to dealing with the media

550
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,120
in daily life.

551
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,050
But for ordinary people,

552
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,920
they may never

553
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:33,780
encounter the same situation as you.

554
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,110
So she feels nervous

555
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,360
and more repulsive.

556
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,720
Really?

557
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,210
Are they all like that?

558
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:41,830
This is the normal behaviour logic

559
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,280
of ordinary human beings.

560
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,360
So

561
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,120
give Yun Lan more time.

562
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,620
Or

563
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,210
she’ll become more and more nervous

564
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,720
and repulsive to you.

565
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:54,650
Nian Nian,

566
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,750
I realised

567
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,960
you know a lot about women.

568
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,220
I just tried to

569
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,690
understand

570
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,090
the problems you just mentioned.

571
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,760
Gender attributes are not included.

572
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,310
That's why I can analyse it.

573
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,540
There seems to be a story.

574
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,050
What's wrong with you and Yun Shu?

575
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,360
I made a formal confession

576
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:11,970
to Yun Shu.

577
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,500
You finally did that to her.

578
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,210
Okay,

579
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,250
But the two of us

580
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,880
have just fallen in the relationship.

581
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,030
What do you mean?

582
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,750
I'm far worse

583
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,090
than Yun Shu's

584
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,370
ideal boyfriend.

585
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,530
Nian Nian,

586
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,850
I think you finally got it.

587
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,510
You're no longer a fool of love.

588
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,270
If you want to become

589
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,960
your girlfriend's ideal boyfriend,

590
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,550
I can give you some tips.

591
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,520
You?

592
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,230
With the way you and Yun Lan turned out,

593
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,030
What can you teach me?

594
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,890
That won't last for too long.

595
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:50,990
Okay,

596
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,410
Then tell me

597
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,560
how are you going to teach me?

598
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,560
Watch my show!

599
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,900
Many viewers treat my show

600
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,970
as a love bible.

601
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,940
Come on.

602
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,420
Are your shows legit?

603
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,720
Of course.

604
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,120
When you watch my shows,

605
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:05,730
do you get

606
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,880
a little

607
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:07,780
sense of love.

608
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,440
Not at all.

609
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,470
Are you a monster?

610
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,580
Many people get diabetes

611
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,960
because my show was so sweet.

612
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,490
Why don't you feel anything?

613
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,970
I didn't feel the sweetness

614
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,610
just a sickening feeling.

615
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,510
Okay.

616
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,040
You don't need to understand it anyway.

617
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,960
Let me show you.

618
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,720
Let me tell you something.

619
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:27,690
Trust me.

620
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,400
Girls like this very much.

621
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,480
They like to get pressed against a wall.

622
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,560
At that moment, girls will think,

623
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,540
wow,

624
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,960
you're so brave.

625
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,490
Get it?

626
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,160
I'll try it.

627
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,610
Let me tell you something.

628
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:09,570
Trust me.

629
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,280
Girls like this very much.

630
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,410
They like to get pressed against a wall.

631
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,260
Mr Zhang.

632
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,240
Are you all right?

633
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,620
You liar!

634
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,290
Look...

635
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,420
Did I hurt you?

636
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,090
No, no, no.

637
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:29,920
Why are you here?

638
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:30,430
You scared me.

639
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,010
I just came to see

640
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,320
if I can help you with something.

641
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:32,710
Here...

642
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,610
Look out!

643
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,580
Go on!

644
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,280
Handsome.

645
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,240
Mr Zhang.

646
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,930
Do you want to sleep together tonight?

647
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,580
Isn't this one of my

648
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,920
comic books?

649
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,370
Where did you find it?

650
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,400
I found it on that day when

651
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,760
I helped you move in.

652
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,620
How nostalgic.

653
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,000
It was so long ago.

654
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,639
I thought they were all lost.

655
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,850
Sorry, Yun Shu.

656
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,620
I saw one of the pages

657
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,000
without your permission.

658
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,889
It was about your
mate selection criteria.

659
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:30,760
I found out

660
00:32:30,889 --> 00:32:32,050
I'm far below the standard.

661
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,940
I wrote this a long time ago.

662
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,889
I didn't understand
anything at that time.

663
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,429
So it doesn't count.

664
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,590
Mr Zhang.

665
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,040
You're already good enough.

666
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,320
But seeing your standards,

667
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,030
I suddenly realized that

668
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,920
I really don't seem to
know much about romance.

669
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,760
I've never given you surprises

670
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,600
or made you feel excited.

671
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,969
For me,

672
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,010
this can't be solved by mathematics.

673
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,760
♫ You're a familiar stranger ♫

674
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,640
It's alright as long as we
can feel the love of each other.

675
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,960
♫ Who keeps appearing before me ♫

676
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,640
So

677
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,250
♫ You're clumsy yet kind ♫

678
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,890
♫ Ringing the bell in my heart ♫

679
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,580
tonight,

680
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,530
do you want to sleep together or not?

681
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:27,530
♫ You predict and plan, but you can't
solve the problem called love ♫

682
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,730
♫ Let me tell you, just hold my hand ♫
