[Episode 19]

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,960
Have you made your mind?

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,600
It's almost interdisciplinary.

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,360
Sometimes you change
your hobby into your job,

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,860
but at last you find it totally
different from what you thought.

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,570
Yi Yi.

9
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,580
Fair enough.

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,500
But I think

11
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,200
I'll regret it

12
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,400
if I don't give it a try.

13
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:25,900
Well, I got your back.

14
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,070
We are young anyway.

15
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,480
We shouldn't be afraid to try.

16
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,140
Let's go shopping and get pretty.

17
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,600
-Let's go.
-Okay.

18
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,000
Look.

19
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,120
Come on!

20
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,080
Hold or not?

21
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,150
Hurry up! Come on.

22
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,820
Shall we go over and talk to them?

23
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:57,940
He almost got it.

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,240
Come on.

25
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,920
Sorry for bothering.

26
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:23,320
Just offer your hand if you like her.

27
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:25,279
You've got it wrong.

28
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,910
We are just friends.

29
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,600
More than friends,

30
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,850
less than lovers, right?

31
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,650
If someone still doesn't take action,

32
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,920
maybe he will miss the right one.

33
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,370
Su Yu,

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,710
I've loved you for a long time.

35
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,750
Me too.

36
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,050
So that's what people call

37
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,080
the goddess with beauty and wisdom.

38
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:51,100
Wait. I'm going to talk to her.

39
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,580
Wait a minute, Yi Yi.

40
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,200
-Hey, miss.
-That's too bold.

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,800
What's the matter?

42
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,840
Nothing.

43
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,600
I just think you were so cool.

44
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,630
On that occasion,

45
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,170
very few would dare to do that

46
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,610
for fearing of being called...

47
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,840
A meddler, right?

48
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,280
You both

49
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,810
must also think that I'm a meddler.

50
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,280
No. It's not true.

51
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,150
Maybe my friend

52
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,960
is a little thoughtless.

53
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:17,780
So,

54
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,960
please don't mind.

55
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,070
It's alright.

56
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,159
I just feel one should be brave

57
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,450
in a relationship,

58
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,560
or

59
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,880
you'll miss the one

60
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,170
before knowing it.

61
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,880
I was anxious to help.

62
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,600
Well, I have to go. Bye.

63
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,620
Good.

64
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,600
Bye.

65
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,880
What a beauty!

66
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,370
Yi Yi.

67
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,590
I know you are good
at hooking up with boys.

68
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,880
I didn't expect you could
even hit on a lady.

69
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:50,890
Resign?

70
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,410
You are going to work
at a comic studio?

71
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,390
Days ago, Mei showed me

72
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,090
their recruiting poster.

73
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,050
So...

74
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,370
I want to try it.

75
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,680
You want to work at the comic studio??

76
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,840
You don't have to resign first.

77
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:04,810
You can just try your hands
there for a couple of day

78
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:05,650
and come back if it's not suitable.

79
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,470
That's no good.

80
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,420
That kind of behavior is so-called
'having a foot in both camps'.

81
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,340
Maybe my expression is not very accurate.

82
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,700
We usually call that

83
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,840
'riding a donkey while
looking for a horse'.

84
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,840
Mr Meng,

85
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,820
I know what I decided to do

86
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,400
might betray your trust in me.

87
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,050
Stop.

88
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,440
Don't make it like you were
accepting education here.

89
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,930
Have you really made up your mind?

90
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,280
I will not stop trying

91
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,290
even I fail this time.

92
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,360
I know you really love comics.

93
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,900
But I still want to tell you that

94
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,700
it doesn't always turn
out to be a good thing

95
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,180
to treat your hobby as your job.

96
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,600
However, you have my support.

97
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,990
Do the handover later.

98
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,120
Mr Meng, thank you so much.

99
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,250
Stop!

100
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,000
Don't pretend to be so innocent.

103
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,650
Your grandson is not here?

104
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,620
Dr Zhang.

105
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,960
Just say it.

106
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,410
It's

107
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,970
serious, right?

108
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,050
I think we'd better
wait for your grandson.

109
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,990
Don't worry.

110
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,120
I can take it.

111
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,520
Don't bother the young ones.

112
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,660
I suggest

113
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,390
you stay in the hospital.

114
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,820
It's not like home.

115
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,070
Just tell me

116
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,470
how much time is left

117
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,790
You are making things hard.

118
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,800
Dr Zhang.

119
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,640
Just let me spend

120
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,480
my remaining time with the kids.

121
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,510
Grandpa Zhang?

Lin Nuo.

123
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,870
I'll leave the key of
the rest room to you.

124
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,450
-Got off work?
-Yeah.

125
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,940
Thank you for covering
for me the day before.

126
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,900
I'll treat you to a movie
some other day, okay?

127
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,680
Don't bother.

128
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,390
It's not a big deal.

129
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,490
Then,

130
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,700
a meal together?

131
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,530
Okay.

132
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,140
I'll choose an expensive restaurant.

133
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,120
No problem.
I'll offer my one-month salary.

134
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,950
No. That's too big an amount

135
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,160
to spend on me.

136
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,930
Go home and have some rest.

137
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,400
See you then.

138
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,680
Bye.

139
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,600
Hey.

140
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,400
The patient is calling.

141

143
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,190
Yi Yi, I'll leave first.

144
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,220
Why didn't you pick my calls?

145
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,230
You know the answer.

146
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,470
Why should I pick up your phone?

147
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,450
Yi Yi.

148
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,380
You are not even giving
me a chance to explain.

149
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,300
Douchebags always have
all kinds of excuses.

150
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,730
Which one will you use today?

151
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,800
The girl you met before.

152
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,420
Yeah, she used to be my girlfriend

153
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,780
my family found for me.

154
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,150
We dated for a period of time

155
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,360
and found that we were not for each other.

156
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,760
So we broke up.

157
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,890
Then I met you.

158
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:33,980
But her mum

159
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,360
had a heart attack

160
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,870
for which a surgery was needed.

161
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:38,770
So you see,

162
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,940
to console her mum,

163
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,009
she asked me to pretend
that I was still her boyfriend.

164
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,220
I had to say yes.

165
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,350
The story is touching.

166
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,180
But I don't believe it.

167
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,150
Yi Yi.

168
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,600
I can bring you to her

169
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,950
if you don't believe.

170
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,210
Let her tell you the truth.

171
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,100
You are really good at making up stories.

172
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:57,950
What?

173
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,210
Even the actor is prepared?

174
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,220
Why are you here?

175
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,500
Lin Nuo.

176
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,720
I'm telling you now,

177
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,870
I never lied to her.

178
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,650
Yi Yi.

179
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,650
You don't really believe that, do you?

180
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,800
Didn't you say that you would go home

181
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,540
after night duty

182
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,700
and have dinner with me?

183
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,560
Why did you come here?

184
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,650
I was just on my way

185
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,070
and wondering if I
could have lunch with you.

186
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,740
You two are dating?

187
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:27,770
Yes.

188
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:28,970
We're together.

189
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,000
Yi Yi.

190
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,440
Is that true?

191
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,900
Let's go. I'm hungry.

192
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,870
Let's go for lunch.

193
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,530
I just watched a video online.

194
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,370
A man and a kid.

195
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,290
The man's right foot

196
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,290
stepped forward

197
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,920
while getting out the car

198
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,050
and kicked the kid to the ground.

199
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,020
The kid

200
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,850
fell into a dirty puddle.

201
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,060
So funny, right?

202
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,620
Funny.

203
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,860
You didn't even listen to me.

204
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,240
Tell me again.

205
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,910
I will definitely laugh my head off.

206
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,160
You believed him, didn't you?

207
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,010
No, I didn't.

208
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,130
I don't believe what he said.

209
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,100
It's okay.

210
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,670
Just tell me your thoughts.

211
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,320
You can say anything

212
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,570
to your best friend.

213
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,580
It's not important
whether I believe or not.

214
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,020
You are my boyfriend now.

215
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,550
What do you mean?

216
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,490
Well, you also can regret it.

217
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,530
Regret?

218
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,290
Lin Nuo. Are you kidding me?

219
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,920
Regret now? Fine.

220
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:33,950
Okay, I regret it.

221
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,920
Is that okay?

222
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,390
No, no. Yi Yi.

223
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,450
Just a joke.

224
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:40,850
A joke?

225
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,210
Something cannot be taken

226
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,260
for a joke.

227
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,600
Okay.

228
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,410
I promise

229
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,820
I will never say that kind
of nonsense anymore.

230
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,560
Come here.

231
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,140
Your favorite soup.

232
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,920
Never again!

233
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,760
I promise.

234
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,150
One more spoon.

235
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,310
Yun Shu,

236
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,880
I really don't want to let you go.

237
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,420
You haven't introduced your cousin to me.

238
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,500
Is he really married?

239
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,020
He's married.

240
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,080
Yun Shu.

241
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,350
What are you doing here?

242
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,010
I'm here to get you home.

243
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,580
Cousin, hi.

244
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,300
Is everything done?

245
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,730
Yeah, it's done.

246
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,700
That's good.

247
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,900
Okay, Li An.

248
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,820
We're leaving.

249
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,790
Yun Shu.

250
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,260
Shall we

251
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,770
have dinner with your cousin?

252
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,740
No, thanks.

253
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,360
We have other plans today.

254
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,670
And

255
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,750
I'm not her cousin.

256
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,170
I'm her husband.

257
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,040
What?

258
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,000
Let's go.

259
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,460
♫ You're a familiar stranger ♫

260
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,970
♫ Who keeps appearing before me ♫

261
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,080
♫ You're clumsy yet kind ♫

262
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,590
♫ Ringing the bell in my heart ♫

263
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,590
♫ You predict and plan ♫

264
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,380
Yun Lan.

265
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,570
Shall we have a talk?

266
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,280
I have an appointment tonight.

267
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,250
Some other day.

268
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,860
Don't always avoid me.

269
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,560
I understand why you hesitate.

270
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,160
But since we decided to love each other,

271
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,080
we must try to accept the other's life.

272
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,370
But I...

273
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,020
Miss Yun Lan.

274
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,150
I have to go.

275
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,840
Mr Han.

276
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,980
Why are you here?

277
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,790
I said I would pick you up.

278
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,240
I won't eat my words.

279
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,300
Actually, I can go there by myself.

280
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,270
That won't be okay.

281
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,320
It's my pleasure

282
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,490
to take Miss Yun.

283
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,580
Come on, be careful.

284
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,870
A'Mei.

285
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,320
Find me Mr Han's schedule tonight.

286
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,510
Okay.

287
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,620
Mr Han.

288
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,410
Do you like Yun Lan?

289
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:38,880
Come on.

290
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,110
Come on.

291
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,430
Cheers.

292
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,520
Cheers.

293
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,810
Drink it up.

294
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,850
It's not going to work.

295
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,090
Mr Han, Miss Yun.

296
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,630
Miss Yun, here's to you.

297
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,860
Here.

298
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,550
Here's to you.

299
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,690
Cheers!

300
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,900
Have fun, everybody.

301
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,110
I have to go there.

302
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,600
I think maybe we can deepen

303
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,150
our relationship.

304
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,400
Hurry up! One more glass.

305
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,530
We work well together.

306
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,310
We might also be suitable
for each other in life.

307
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,600
Mr Han, it's getting late

308
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:20,450
I have to go.

309
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,810
There is a meeting tomorrow morning.

310
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,000
It's early.

311
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,630
I heard that lawyers

312
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,930
are all night owls.

313
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,940
Wait.

314
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,050
Just hold on, everybody.

315
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,730
Miss Yun is going to go.

316
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,380
Let's drink a toast to her!

317
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,210
Okay, we shall have a toast.

318
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,180
Okay.

319
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,310
Fill up your glasses.

320
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,720
Miss Yun.

321
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,930
The last one.

322
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,610
Miss Yun.

323
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,800
The last one.

324
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,110
Yeah, the last one.

325
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:49,810
Miss Yun.

326
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,720
This is the last toast to you.

327
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,250
Wish you success in your career

328
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,100
and good health.

329
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:54,590
Come on.

330
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,730
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

331
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,910
-Come on.
-The last toast.

332
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,250
-Come on.
-Cheers!

333
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,140
Cheers!

334
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,110
Drink it up.

335
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,570
Wait.

336
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,000
Who are you?

337
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,100
Her boyfriend.

338
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,090
He's Lu Yu.

339
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,150
Yes, it's him.

340
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,170
Sorry.

341
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,620
Mr Han.

342
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,310
-We have to go.
-Yun Lan.

343
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,460
Don't leave us hanging.

344
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,520
Everybody is holding the glass for you.

345
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,040
You cannot refuse the toast.

346
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,210
Okay. I'll have it.

347
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,600
I'll have it for her.

348
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,600
That's a bit rude.

349
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,220
Can we leave now?

350
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,040
They left just like that.

351
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,870
So disrespectful.

352
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,860
Yeah, Mr Han.

353
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,250
Of course.

354
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,970
That's Lu Yu, the popular actor.

355
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:45,950
Interesting.

356
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,040
Just save it.

357
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,740
Forget it. Let's go home.

358
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,140
Watch the steps.

359
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,300
-What's the matter?
-Don't come near.

360
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,440
You only had one glass.

361
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:05,840
What's the matter?

362
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,890
I think those scums

363
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,050
drugged the wine.

364
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,400
Are you okay?

365
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,520
Shall I take you to the hospital?

366
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,780
What?

367
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,550
What do you want?

368
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,610
What do you think?

369
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,380
If you dare to offend,

370
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,170
I'll kick you out.

371
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,240
Will you?

372
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,160
I'm the hero who just saved you.

373
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,440
You look more like

374
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,150
a lame duck.

375
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,400
If your fans see you right now,

376
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,820
they will surely cancel you.

377
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,800
You even know canceling!

378
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,130
You seem to have done a lot

379
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,360
to understand me.

380
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,920
It's all in your mind.

381
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,690
You are

382
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,760
good in every way,

385
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,630
You are my puzzle.

386
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,760
But I do not know how to love you.

387
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,420
You've filmed so many idol series.

388
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,490
None of them became true?

389
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:53,730
I don't believe it.

390
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,410
Maybe I have too many defects.

391
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,400
Others think I'm an idler,

392
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,260
naive and disloyal.

393
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,790
No one really wants to
get to know me.

394
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,280
My works were

395
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,120
all like inferior products.

396
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,250
I don't think they are true love.

397
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,320
But after I met you,
I found that

398

fickleness and narcissism.]

[Everyday,]

403

[I want to know more about you,]

404

[Contrary to the unrealistic love dramas,]

406

I want to hand in a

411
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,820
comic about dating with an
overbearing CEO in the interview.

412
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,280
But it's totally not my field.

413
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,750
Overbearing CEO.

414

I know someone.

415
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,490

416
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,240
whether he is the right person.

comic about an overbearing CEO.

420
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,510
She needs to ask you some questions.

421
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,960
You've turned to the right person.

422
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,640
I'm an expert taking on
overbearing CEO characters.

423
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,740
Firstly, his name should be powerful.

424
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,310
[Like, Murong Huohai.]

425
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,290
[Nangong Xian.]

426
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,240
[Second, he must be handsome.]

427
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,930
-[Just like me.]
-Like I said,

428
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,580
he probably would not be reliable.

429
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,550
Very handsome.

430
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,530
And he must be a weird loner,

431
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,600
[putting a cold face before everyone]

432
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,510
[but so affectionate to the heroine.]

433
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,520
That make some sense.

434

[Understand?]

435
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,460
[And finally he has to say
something tough.]

436
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,340
Like, "This is the kingdom

437
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,930
I have plundered for you."

438

Kind of.

Don't be nervous.

00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,550
used to be my girlfriend

572
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,040
my family had found for me.

573
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,550
We dated for a period of time

574
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,940
and found that we were not for each other.

575
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:20,960
So we broke up.

576
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,120
Then I met you.

577
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,580
But her mum
had a heart attack

578
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,150
for which a surgery was needed.

579
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,010
So you see?

580
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,670
So...

581
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,510
Do you believe him?

582
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,310
My instinct tells me
that he was not lying to me.

583
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Yi Yi.

584
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,880
Has your instinct ever worked?

585
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,920
Of course.

586
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,500
My instinct was right about you

587
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,650
and Mr Zhang, wasn't it?

588
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,110
Then,

589
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,580
What about Lin Nuo?

590
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,760
Are you breaking up with him?

591
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,160
I never thought about
breaking up with him.

592
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,060
Then what about Gu Xiao?

593
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,040
No idea.

594
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,270
But I have forgiven him.

595
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,440
You still love him?

596
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,890
I don't know.

597
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,220
Don't ask me such difficult questions.

598
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,250
Will you continue looking
for romantic quotes?

599
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,760
Yes, of course.

600
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:31,760
Come on, go on.

601
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,270

603
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,460
Pretty good.

604
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,960
Worth reading.

605
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,630
Pretty interesting.

606
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,600
Yes.

607
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,080
Very special.

608
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,060
All right.

609
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,320
So what do you think?

610
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,290
Feel free to talk.

611
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,060
I think it's attractive

612
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,760
right from the title.

613
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,740
I think the form is interesting.

614
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,510
Totally agree.

616
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,320
My opinion is

617
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,530
that we are well prepared

618
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,680
to publish it serially.

619
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,540
Since everybody agrees,

620
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,220

628

I going to tell you a good news.

664
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,070
I, Yun Shu,

665
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,880
have become a real Internet cartoonist.

666
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,550
My comic will

667
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,010
be published online next week.

668
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,760
And it's serialized.

669
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:18,839
Actually, I wanted

670
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,390
to celebrate it

671
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,930
with Mr Zhang and other friends.

672
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,589
But they are so busy.

673
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:27,990
Nobody cares.

674
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:30,890
Congratulations.

675
00:32:31,109 --> 00:32:32,330
You finally became

676
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:35,060
a real cartoonist as
you've always wanted.

677
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,919
But I have a question.

678
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,879
You must give me the true answer.

679
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,770
Many netizens

680
00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:44,439
are curious as to

681
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,720
why your comic is so sweet.

682
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,540
Is it because you had some

683
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,240
sweet love experiences in your life?

684
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,390
Well, it's a little bit
difficult to answer.

685
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,390
I suddenly

686
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,010
came up with the inspiration

687
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:04,200
after Mr Zhang forced a kiss on me.

688
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,610
And then I just drew it.

689
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,150
How do you plan to

690
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,740
celebrate when Mr Zhang comes back?

691
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,270
I have to think about it properly.

692
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,240
Get ready.

693
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,470

694
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,170

I think it's good.

760
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,530
Call me that in the future.

761
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,870
Do not call me Mr Zhang anymore.

762
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:01,880
But... Mr Zhang,

763
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:04,890
I can't bring myself
to call you that.

764
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,350
Then practise.

765
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,700
Practise?

766
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,710
Until you can say it.

767
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,440
Mr Zhang.

768
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,360
Honey.

769
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,950
Honey...
