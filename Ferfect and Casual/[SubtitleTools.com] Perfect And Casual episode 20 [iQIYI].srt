OK

192
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,990
Hi, waiter!

193
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:12,250
Hi.

194
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,430
What can I get for you two?

195
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,410
A cup of cold brew

196
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,600
I'd like a cup of latte

197
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,480
90 Celsius degree water.

198
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,400
Vapour pressure at 3 bars.

199
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,080
Pine-leaf shaped latte art.

200
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,430
Thank you

201
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,560
I'll be back.

202
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,940
Very unique drinking style of you.

203
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,730
Learned from a friend

204
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,780
many years ago

205
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,230
I've got used to it.

206
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,580
So... your friend must
be important to you, right?

207
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,970
The one you are waiting
for hasn't come yet?

208
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,950
Let me text her

209
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,400
to see where she is.

210
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,380
Are you Si Hua Nian?

211
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,750
You are Yun Shu?

212
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,850
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

213
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,270
I didn't mean to do that.

214
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,100
I just honestly don't know

215
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,600
these words are copyrighted.

216
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,980
I am so, so sorry.

217
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,430
Sorry.

218
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,140
I will never ever

219
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,150
make such a mistake again.

220
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,110
If you.

221
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,280
Sit down please.

222
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,680
Not a big deal for me.

223
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,020
I actually made an appointment with you

224
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,600
to tell you that

225
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,210
I will withdraw the charge.

226
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,690
You... you are not suing me?

227
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,750
Actually, I wrote those words

228
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,020
while I was studying abroad,

229
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,380
when I get bored.

230
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,850
Earlier the agent company

231
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:20,950
suddenly called me

232
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,910
saying

233
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,510
there was someone
plagiarizing my words online

234
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,690
and they will issue a
lawyer's letter to protect rights.

235
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,430
I was too busy at that time

236
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,640
so I agreed with that.

237
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,570
It just occurred to me yesterday.

238
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,450
I hurried to search online

239
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,880
to read your comics

240
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,780
I'd like to know how you plagiarized.

241
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,270
But I didn't expect that

242
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,900
I like your comic.

243
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,290
Perfect And Casual.

244
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,310
You... you really like it?

245
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,980
If you find it appropriate

246
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,810
I'd like to cooperate with you.

247
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,170
That is to say, in the future

248
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,840
if you need words for your comic,

249
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,300
I'd like to be a part of that.

250
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,080
Great!

251
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,100
It... it will be my honour.

252
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,750
For this special cooperation.

253
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,940
Cheers.

254
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,150
Mr Zhang,

255
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,280
I will not be charged.

256
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,480
Looks like she has withdrawn the charge.

257
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,390
Then she is a good person.

258
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,100
She is a

259
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,710
kind-hearted and beautiful lady.

260
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,450
If you are Mr Perfect

261
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,300
she will be Ms Perfect then.

262
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,700
It's a pity that you
are no longer available.

263
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,000
So she has no chances.

264
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,030
Will you come down now?

265
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,520
Nevertheless, the beautiful lady

266
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,380
has the same taste of coffee as you do.

267
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:47,780
Is it so?

268
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,450
What's more,

269
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,060
eat less food with sugar.

270
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,350
It is not good for health.

271
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,350
Got it?

272
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,400
Sweet?

273
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,550
Yes.

274
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,810
That company has withdrawn the charge.

275
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,250
Now,

276
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,430
I have already signed

277
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,710
a cooperation agreement with her.

278
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,850
She is really kind-hearted and beautiful.

279
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,280
You should seize the opportunity

280
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,980
tightly.

281
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:39,930
Lin Nuo got promoted.

282
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,970
Would you join us for a meal on weekend?

283
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,200
Get Mr Zhang please.

284
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,550
I can do that.

285
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,510
But

286
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,450
isn't it better to leave you two alone?

287
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,030
Why invite us?

288
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,950
A world for two sounds good

289
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,180
but... but the more the merrier.

290
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,600
Did you quarrel?

291
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,770
I don't know why.

292
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,270
Me and Lin Nuo,

293
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,560
when we were alone,

294
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,310
I feel uncomfortable.

295
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,830
Uncomfortable?

296
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,150
Before you two getting back together,

297
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,800
aren't you being with
each other all day long?

298
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,830
Yes.

299
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,800
When we were not together,

300
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,330
it feels fine even we
see each other everyday.

301
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,130
But now, as long as he
kisses me or holds me.

302
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,300
I...

303
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,000
I just feel uncomfortable.

304
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:23,970
It's like...

305
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,830
I am dating you.

306
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,300
You know what I mean?

307
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,960
It's truly weird if so.

308
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,300
So now, every time he asks me out,

309
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,650
I want to have someone with me.

310
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,500
At least one more person,

311
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,910
it would have been less awkward.

312
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,100
Lin Nuo

313
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,730
what are you talking about?

314
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,800
Nothing special.

315
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,420
Didn't we say meet at the restaurant?

316
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,500
What do you do here?

317
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,090
I am off night duty,
so I come here directly.

318
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,310
Hey, Yun Shu.

319
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,420
A few days earlier,

320
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,400
I met Grandpa Zhang in the hospital

321
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,070
grandpa,

322
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,040
Right.

323
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:05,960
Yun Shu.

324
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,000
Shall we have a lunch together?

325
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,020
Yi Yi,

326
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,250
I have some business later.

327
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,680
Another day maybe?

328
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,430
You really don't want to go?

329
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,360
I really have some business.

330
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,500
It hurts!

331
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,020
So... you are really leaving?

332
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:28,830
I will leave you two alone

333
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,330
in your little world for two.

334
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,960
Very few people here.

335
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,670
Thank you.

336
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,050
Your payroll day today?

337
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,570
Such a high-end restaurant

338
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,550
I promised you a long time ago,

339
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,980
and today is a good day.

340
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,340
So be it.

341
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,670
What can I get for you two?

342
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,640
Right.

343
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,980
I have reserved a combo online.

344
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,630
Just serve the combo.

345
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,070
No problem, a moment please.

346
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,130
OK, thanks.

347
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,320
Lin Nuo.

348
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:14,100
Why are you so generous today?

349
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:14,980
Tell me.

350
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:15,770
Did you do something

351
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,940
sorry for me?

352
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,580
You are thinking this way.

353
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,350
Then forget about it.

354
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,379
Let's leave, I am not eating.

355
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:22,720
Just kidding.

356
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:23,700
Let's have lunch here.

357
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:27,210
We finally made it here.

358
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,570
Here you go.

359
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,960
Yi Yi.

360
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,230
Have you ever thought about

361
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,370
our future?

362
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,270
No, I didn't.

363
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,840
Why are you planning so long?

364
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,020
Have you thought.

365
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,490
Sometimes, I think...

366
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,080
I feel that

367
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,820
the city we are living in is so big

368
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,190
and the pace of life is so fast.

369
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,780
If it is possible,

370
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,960
I want to take you to my hometown.

371
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,000
I have saved some money,

372
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,510
we can start a small business

373
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,170
and live a life without quarrels

374
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,610
without worries,

375
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,030
a peaceful life.

376
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,550
What do you say?

377
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,060
You are saying

378
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,300
leave here.

379
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,270
Yes.

380
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,300
No matter where we are,

381
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,500
I will be good to you with all my heart.

382
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,720
If you are unhappy,

383
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,940
I will make you happy.

384
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,220
If you don't have money,

385
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,350
I will go make money.

386
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,040
I will not let you down.

387
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,540
Lin Nuo.

388
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,820
I'm really moved

389
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,530
by what you just said.

390
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,830
I really appreciate it.

391
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,600
However,

392
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,960
we fought so hard

393
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,200
to stay in this city, right?

394
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,600
Now that we are here

395
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,430
why not keep up a little bit?

396
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,990
Sir, your meal.

397
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,360
Thank you.

398
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,150
Who is that?

399
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,400
Insurance sale.

400
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,000
Already made several calls today.

401
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,040
It's alright.

402
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,180
Let's have some steak.

403
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,720
This is the experimental subject's

404
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,100
report from three months' ago.

405
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,850
This the newest data report.

406
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,480
By comparison, we can find that

407
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,050
with the new algorithm,

408
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,380
the data from the experimental subject

409
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,830
have shown large differences.

410
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,600
I think it might because
in the new algorithm,

411
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,320
we have adjusted the
heart rate monitoring cycle

412
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,750
to three times higher.

413
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,930
Three effective cycles

414
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,930
changed the average value of the sample.

415
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:45,820
That's right.

416
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,350
So the data of the experimental subject

417
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,020
has raised some issues.

418
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,050
Professor Zhang,

419
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,770
I heard that you and
Mr Lin are classmates.

420
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,070
In university

421
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,960
you had good teamwork.

422
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,500
When we were on campus,

423
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,010
we were in the same research group.

424
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,430
You two have been
legends of your university.

425
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,500
So called a formidable combination

426
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,810
is being afraid of nothing.

427
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,630
Mr Lin,

428
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,060
do you have a boyfriend?

429
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,360
No.

430
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,270
That's great.

431
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,820
Professor Zhang
doesn't have a girlfriend.

432
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,930
If you two can continue the story,

433
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,030
that would be fantastic.

434
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,870
That is a couple of legends.

435
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,730
Everyone would envy that.

436
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,760
I am already married.

437
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,850
Si Nian.

438
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,550
Si Nian.

439
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,610
They all say that

440
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,300
a campus life without campus love

441
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,390
is incomplete.

442
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,280
You are about to graduate

443
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,210
don't you want to try it?

444
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,470
The best years of a mathematician

445
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,210
is before 35 years old.

446
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,240
So before winning the Fields Medal.

447
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:01,970
Any emotion

448
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,030
shall not be considered by me.

449
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,370
What's the matter?

450
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,680
Aren't you going to the lab?

451
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,420
Sure.

452
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,840
Let's go.

453
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,790
Si Nian.

454
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,070
Chu Chu.

455
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,040
Anything else?

456
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,440
You married?

457
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,060
Yes.

458
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,430
How long?

459
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,430
Almost a year.

460
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,260
What's the matter?

461
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,020
No.

462
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,180
I am just a bit surprised.

463
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,810
Didn't you say

464
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,160
before winning the Fields Medal

465
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,830
any emotional problem

466
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,980
shall not be considered by you?

467
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,940
Yes.

468
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,750
I used to think that way.

469
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,550
But when I met my wife,

470
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,200
I realised

471
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,960
I might be a bit naive at that time.

472
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,370
Life

473
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,060
doesn't have to be one way or the other.

474
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,180
Sometimes if you look in another way,

475
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,060
you can get more.

476
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,010
I am just curious.

477
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,900
What kind of girl

478
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,770
can change you so much.

479
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,020
She is a girl that with a
little less attention paid,

480
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,410
she will get in trouble.

481
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,200
Yun Shu.

482
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,620
Aren't you going to buy
something for your husband?

483
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,910
It is our shopping time.

484
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,070
You are right.

485
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:26,300
Chu Chu,

486
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,000
I never knew

487
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,760
you were a shopaholic.

488
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,880
When women are in a bad mood,

489
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,250
there are two ways to let off steam.

490
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,650
Eat like you are dying

491
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,060
or shop like you are dying.

492
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,800
I don't want to become fat.

493
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,570
Shopping

494
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,280
sounds much easier.

495
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,520
Well, let's see what we have got.

496
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,110
You must be in real bad mood.

497
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:46,920
Kind of.

498
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,210
About the relationship?

499
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,730
Nice hit.

500
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,500
Chu Chu.

501
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,570
Excellent as you are,

502
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,370
you should have no problems with work

503
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,580
then there's only one
option left, relationship.

504
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,580
I found that

505
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,400
the man I love

506
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:08,750
was married.

507
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:12,850
Chu Chu

508
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,010
are you OK?

509
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,560
I'm OK.

510
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,660
There is another store ahead.

511
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,170
Today

512
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,640
we will shop until we die.

513
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,060
Chu Chu.

514
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,610
You want a drink?

515
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,690
OK

516
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,310
So, Chu Chu,

517
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,720
he is the guy you told me?

518
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,580
Mr Perfect?

519
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,170
Come on.

520
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:55,480
We are classmates in university

521
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,040
we joined the university's
debate team together.

522
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,180
We were in the same
school when study abroad

523
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,030
even after graduation,

524
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,510
we went to the same research institute.

525
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,410
We were

526
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,590
reading recommended books together,

527
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,480
doing experiments together,

528
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:14,890
always together.

529
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,350
The books you recommended to me?

530
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,830
Sophie's World.

531
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,750
The Conquest of Happiness by B. Russell.

532
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,380
And the.

533
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,530
An invitation to philosophy.

534
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,710
You still remember?

535
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,030
I am planning on reading
in the next few days.

536
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,710
Those

537
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,780
are my memories with him.

538
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,490
What happened after that?

539
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,490
I once thought

540
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,200
I could keep going on with him.

541
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,460
Getting married with him sooner or later.

542
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,930
But afterwards,

543
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,650
he went back to China earlier
than me to deal with his business.

544
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,880
Why didn't you

545
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,930
come back with him together?

546
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,530
My advisor and I

547
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,980
were working on a project.

548
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,690
I really can't leave.

549
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,060
Then

550
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,160
does he know that you like him?

551
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,950
I think he should know.

552
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,330
Now think of before

553
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,150
my feelings to him.

554
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,760
It is admiration at the beginning.

555
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,530
But it turns out

556
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,520
we have so many interests

557
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,710
in common.

558
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,800
We are becoming more and
more tacit while doing things.

559
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,100
Later on,

560
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,360
I found out he was a complete
amateur

561
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,010
when it comes to romantic relationships.

562
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,160
But I don't know why

563
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,360
I still love him so much.

564
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,950
I was thinking I can wait.

565
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,960
Did he understand your thoughts?

566
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,230
The day he went back to his country,

567
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,130
I went to see him off.

568
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,250
I really hated to see him leaving.

569
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,300
I thought

570
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,630
I had to let him know how I felt.

571
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,700
So I kissed him.

572
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,810
So that's your first kiss?

573
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,960
Did you confess your feelings?

574
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,210
No.

575
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,880
Why?

576
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,830
He was hurry to get on the flight

577
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,400
and we were separated right after that.

578
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:40,950
Did you give up?

579
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,640
Of course not.

580
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,930
I thought we had a tacit understanding.

581
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,330
I didn't expect

582
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,210
when I get back this time,

583
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,780
he is already married.

584
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,760
Chu Chu,

585
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,420
I think I understand

586
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,480
why you wrote

587
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,690
those sad things.

588
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:16,570
Yes

589
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,390
I spent all my time

590
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,960
studying

591
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,830
I had barely no friends

592
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,310
the same when I was abroad

593
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,010
I spent all my time

594
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,910
I spent all my time
in the library with him.

595
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:28,700
I thought

596
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,350
waiting for him to fulfil his dreams.

597
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,900
Then I can confess my feelings to him.

598
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,000
But occasionally in the middle of
the night when it is dark and quiet.

599
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,300
I would think

600
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,050
my insistence on this relationship

601
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,260
is it right or wrong?

602
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,590
So those words on the
internet from that time

603
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,500
were my true feelings in my heart.

604
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,370
Chu Chu.

605
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,660
In the future, if you are unhappy,

606
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,870
you can tell me everything.

607
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,840
Pinkie promise.

608
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,260
Pinkie promise.

609
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,010
Why are you calling so late?

610
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,030
Si Nian was married, do you know that?

611
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,140
I do.

612
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,260
Why he suddenly got married?

613
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:19,980
You are drunk.

614
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,020
Have you ever met his wife?

615
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,990
I have.

616
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,100
What is she like?

617
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,360
She is a

618
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,880
woman that gets you addicted.

619
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,960
Wait

620
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,200
honey.

621
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,310
Are you busy now?

622
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,660
No.

623
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,280
I am thinking.

624
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,210
I have a question.

625
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,570
But

626
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,510
it might be associated
with your privacy.

627
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,480
I don't know if it is
OK for you to answer.

628
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,780
Try me.

629
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,310
Did I have your first kiss?

630
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,910
Definitely yes.

631
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,310
You had mine too.

632
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,780
What is this stiffen thing?

633
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,840
No, I didn't.

634
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,310
You read these books?

635
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,780
Since you called me honey,

636
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,000
I think our relationship

637
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:17,880
may be changed from love

638
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:18,950
to marriage.

639
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,290
So...

640
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,260
So...

641
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,210
I was thinking I should
learn something more.

642
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,800
It might good for our relationship

643
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,430
in the future.

644
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,200
Then,

645
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,280
I will leave you alone.

646
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,710
You surely come from Venus.

647
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:18,730
We have never been
apart for over three days.

648
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,890
With your new love, you
have forgotten the old one.

649
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,700
You just came back

650
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,570
you have no friends

651
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,370
and you are not in a good mood.

652
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,350
So I can only keep her company.

653
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,050
You smile at your new friends

654
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,130
but never cry over your old ones.

655
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,790
I am not in a good mood.

656
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,680
Yi Yi.

657
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:33,450
Don't get angry.

658
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,500
Next time she goes shopping,

659
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,550
we'll go together.

660
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,390
I am not going.

661
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,930
I do not want to be a third wheel.

662
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,020
Yi Yi, let me tell you

663
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,350
your position in my heart.

664
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,670
No one can replace you.

665
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,600
Top of the list.

666
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,890
What about Zhang Si Nian.

667
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,360
He can't beat you.

668
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,270
Hypocritical.

669
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:51,650
Yi Yi.

670
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,850
Don't be mad.

671
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,000
Let's eat out for a special treatment.

672
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,680
It's on me.

673
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,070
I have classes later.

674
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,000
Next time.

675
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:58,970
Put on the record.

676
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,550
Put on the record.

677
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,520
No problem.

678
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,640
Twice.

679
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,710
This is not bad.

680
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:06,480
Si Nian.

681
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,910
What do you want for lunch?

682
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,380
Anything will do.

683
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:10,600
By the way

684
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,710
survey report from the first
phase has been generated.

685
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,300
Contact the headquarter
as soon as possible.

686
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,550
-Have the lab check the data,
-Okay.

687
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,150
so that we can start the second phase

688
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,280
of sample surveys.

689
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:21,850
[Classroom Building]

690
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,680
I will check and send it this afternoon.

691
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,650
Alright.

692
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,570
Si Nian.

693
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,000
Let's have a meal with Meng Ran some day.

694
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,630
Meng Ran?

695
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,440
Bring your wife, too.

696
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,820
I haven't met her.

697
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:31,790
Okay.

698
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:32,980
Look out!

699
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:39,530
Are you all right?

700
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,160
It's alright.

701
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,810
And that time there were...

702
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,110
Mr Zhang.

703
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,810
Chu Chu.

704
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,380
Yun Shu.

705
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,330
What are you doing?

706
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,900
Why are you here at the campus today?

707
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:10,380
I was going to get Yi Yi

708
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,430
and decided to pick you up on the way.

709
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:15,910
Let me introduce officially.

710
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:16,600
Yun Shu

711
00:32:16,689 --> 00:32:17,860
this is my wife.

712
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,280
How did you two known each other?

713
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,950
Chu Chu, also known as.

714
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:25,910
Si Hua Nian.

715
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:29,510
OK, why are you two together now?

716
00:32:30,189 --> 00:32:30,920
Chu Chu is

717
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,080
the director of the project.

718
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:41,030
We were classmates before.

719
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,260
Then let's go to the restaurant.
We will make an appointment the other day.

720
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:48,820
Yun Shu.

721
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:49,499
Wait for me.

722
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,499
I will go get the car.

723
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,470
Okay.

724
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,830
So Chu Chu,

725
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,530
the classmate you mentioned is

726
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,580
Mr Zhang, right?

727
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,360
I didn't expect

728
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,030
you to be Si Nian's newly wedded wife.

729
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,310
Actually, I didn't expect

730
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,080
we'd be talking about the same person.

731
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,130
Our fates

732
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,780
are truly intertwined.
