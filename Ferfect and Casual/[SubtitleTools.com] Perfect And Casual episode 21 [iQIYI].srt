Yun Shu.

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,250
Is there something on your mind?

6
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,750
No.

7
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,960
Maybe I'm just

8
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,370
a little tired today.

9
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,030
Thank you.

10
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,300
I'm going to bed now.

11
00:01:08,929 --> 00:01:09,860
Yun Shu.

12
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,560
Are you not feeling well?

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,700
No.

14
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,180
Maybe I am just a little sleepy.

15
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,910
I'll go back to my room.

16
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,460
Mr Zhang.

17
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,340
Did you and Lin Chu Chu

18
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,950
kiss?

19
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,510
We did, once.

20
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,310
But last time

21
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,150
when I asked if it was your first kiss,

22
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,300
why did you lie to me?

23
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,200
Yun Shu.

24
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,200
Please let me explain.

25
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,660
I'll tell you the situation.

26
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,760
I didn't really want to lie to you.

27
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,880
The reason why

28
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,920
I didn't tell you the situation

29
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,790
[is because]

30
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,220
[I was abroad at that time.]

31
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,910
[I was informed that my
grandfather was hospitalized]

32
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,610

What's the matter?

37
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,380
[I thought]

38
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,600
[it was a courtesy to say goodbye.]

39
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,190
I see.

40
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,880
Then let's all go to bed early.

41
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,750
We're tired today.

42
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,720
Okay.

43
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,690
Goodnight.

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,120
Well...

52
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,400
About what happened last night...

53
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,830
Mr Zhang, I'm in a hurry to go out.

54
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,370
I'll talk to you when I get back.

55
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,580
Take care.

56
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,550
Okay.

57
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,300
You broke up with each other?

58
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:55,770
Impossible!

59
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,730
Lin dared to break up with you?

60

61
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,990
Did you get involved with Gu Xiao again?

63
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,330

65
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,400
Of course I take your side.

66
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,440
So,

67
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,480

It's really annoying.

You're

72
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,220

73
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,310
Not fun!

74
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,870
Okay then.

75
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,340
How about we play games?

76
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:48,950
Okay! Play what?

77
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,020

78
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,560
-Okay.
-Let me ask you first.

79
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,850
Do you like durian or mango?

80
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,530
Mango.

81
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,420
Red or green?

82
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:54,800
Green.

83
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,180

84
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,270
Leonardo.

85
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,150
Gu Xiao or Lin Nuo?

86
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,120
Gu Xiao.

87
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,560
Lin Nuo.

88
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,060
It's just a game.

89
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,460
Don't take it so seriously.

90
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,580
I've always been serious about you.

91
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,810
So have I.

92
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,190
The calls are from Gu Xiao, right?

93
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,520
Yes.

94
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,950
But nothing happened
between us after we broke up.

95
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,110
Lin Nuo, let me explain it.

96
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,480
You don't have to.

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,330
That day, Yun Shu asked you
in the dormitory

98
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,730
if you loved Gu Xiao.

99
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,080
What was your answer?

100
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,580
I haven't thought over at the time.

101
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,850
Actually, I...

102
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,680
Fine.

103
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,250
You haven't figured it out, have you?

104
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,360
Let me think for you.

105
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,150
What do you want?

106
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,940
You like to play Truth or Dare.

107
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,060
I'll go with Dare.

108
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,470
Let's break up.

109
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,920
Relax, Yi Yi.

110
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:54,180
Calm down.

111
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,250
After all, you two
have broken up many times.

112
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,440
Yun Shu.

113
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,170
No, I mean

114
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,030
it's just an ordinary quarrel
between you two.

115
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,480
I'm sure you can make up
in a couple of days.

116
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,750
You did this on purpose today, right?

117
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,380
Every word you said is stinging me.

118
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:07,860
No,

119
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,650
I didn't sleep well last night.

120
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,120
I feel out of it right now.

121
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:11,750
Hold on.

122
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,160
You haven't slept all night?

123
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,270
You usually sleep like a log.

124
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,720
But you didn't last night?

125
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,930
What did you do?

126
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:19,670
Yi Yi.

127
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,830
Do you remember that I told you before

128
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,540
that Chu Chu had a failed relationship?

129
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,730
Her first love

130
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,600
married someone else.

131
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,570
Remember it?

132
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,780
Sure.

133
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,820
You abandoned me

134
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,190
in order to comfort her.

135
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,920
Do you know who her first love was?

136
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,560
Mr Zhang.

137
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,780
Mr Zhang?

138
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,250
You and her first love

139
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,580
are truly enemies.

140
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,850
It's more than that.

141
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,270
Before Mr Zhang returned,

142
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,210
Chu Chu kissed him.

143
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,110
They're both excellent

144
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,350
and perfect.

145
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,130
It's not

146
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,230
an interesting relationship

147
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,720
when the two persons are evenly matched.

148
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,050
It's like looking into a mirror
at themselves every morning.

149
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,700
Have you ever seen two identical puzzles

150
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,110
make a complete one?

151
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,380
What do you mean?

152
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,600
I mean

153
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,660
if Mr Zhang

154
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,230
is really interested in Lin Chu Chu,

155
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,150
he wouldn't have married you.

156
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,120
You're dumb.

157
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,610
You're right.

158
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,420
Yi Yi.

159
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,350
The truth really lies in

160
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,510
your hands.

161
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:30,850
Of course!

162
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,300
I'm never wrong about this.

163
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,060
Since you are worried,

164
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,900
why not ask Mr Zhang directly?

165
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,230
When I heard about it last night,

166
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,270
I was stunned.

167
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,720
How do you feel now?

168
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,700
Are you "alive" now?

169
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,670
Sure.

170
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,980
If you are, ask him now.

171
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,050
Come on.

172
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,980
What about you and Lin Nuo?

173
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,400
I think you're right.

174
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,830
I will leave Lin Nuo alone for a few days.

175
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,990
I think he will beg me
to get back together.

176
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,480
And then I'll punish him.

177
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,440
We'll punish him.

178
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,370
Send a WeChat message.

179
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,910
What about the data?

180
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,210
Take a look, Professor Zhang.

181
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,170
There are still problems with the data.

182
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,340
You're right.

183
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,940
I think so, too.

184
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,180
Professor Zhang.

185
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,590
Your phone is ringing.

186
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,560
Thank you.

187
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,650
[Come back early this evening.]

188
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,090
[See you at home.]

189
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,390
[Okay]

190
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
It's Yun Shu, right?

191
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,780
I’ll have dinner with
Meng Ran in the evening.

192
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,080
Why don't you bring Yun Shu with you?

193
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,110
Meng Ran?

194
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,900
We were classmates and haven't
seen each other for a long time.

195
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,100
-Let's have dinner together.
-Let me ask Yun Shu first.

196
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,820
[Chu Chu and Meng Ran
will have dinner together.]

197
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,500
[She invited us to join.]

198
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,050
She dares to declare war.

199
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:01,870
[Do you want to go?]

200
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,130
Go. You must go.

201
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,080
No. It will be three of us.

202
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,150
I'll do it.

203
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,490
[Okay, honey.]

204
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,780
[Send me the address.]

205
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,250
Is this the shop

206
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,800
where Chu Chu bought clothes?

207
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,730
Yes.

208
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,580
Who says only Lin Chu Chu can wear this.

209
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,240
Do I not look good?

210
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,380
No.

211
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,420
You're very beautiful.

212
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,810
It suits you well.

213
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,150
Sorry, I'm late.

214
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,440
Where are the two?

215
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,960
They have already gone upstairs.

216
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,210
Let's go too.

217
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,180
Okay.

218
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,230
Yun Shu, here you are.

219
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,640
Sorry, I'm late.

220
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,670
Mr Meng, Chu Chu.

221
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,130
What a coincidence.

222
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,870
You look pretty.

223
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,820
All right.

224
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,790
Take a seat.

225
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,910
Okay.

226
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,000
Waiter.

227
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,380
We're ready to order.

228
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,350
Okay.

229
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,560
Who would like to order, please?

230
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,150
Chu Chu.

231
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,990
You just returned from abroad, so
you can order whatever you want to eat.

232
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:49,980
I just came back.

233
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,640
I don't know what's tasty.

234
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,540
Let Yun Shu order.

235
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,900
Let Chu Chu order.

236
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,380
I'm not very good at ordering.

237
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,160
Let Si Nian order.

238
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,820
See what you want to eat.

239
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,790
Pick anything.

240
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,460
We want a Lily-Flavoured
Stewed Angelica Soup.

241
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,500
Okay.

242
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,960
Si Nian, aren't you allergic to lilies?

243
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,600
Then I'll change it.

244
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,430
That's okay.

245
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,060
Help yourself to whatever you want.

246
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,560
Then,

247
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,060
we want a Pan-Seared Green Chili Pepper.

248
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,750
Everyone can eat spicy food, right?

249
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,350
Sure.

250
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,320
Serve one.

251
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,840
Okay.

252
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,340
I can,

253
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,220
but Si Nian doesn't eat spicy food.

254
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,180
You didn't tell me.

255
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,130
When we prepared

256
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,240
spicy dishes,

257
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,650
you ate it too.

258
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,290
I used to not eat too much,

259
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,810
but I can now.

260
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,860
Pick whatever you like.

261
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,430
How about I order?

262
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,860
Yun Shu, let me order.

263
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,200
What's delicious here?

264
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,020
We have a lot.

265
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,380
We can serve every dish on the menu.

266
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,010
Tell me what you want to eat.

267
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,940
And

268
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,260
one more...

269
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,590
What do you want to eat?

270
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,620
Tell me.
Let me order it for you.

271
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,550
Pork Ribs.

272
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,520
Pork Ribs.

273
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,630
Okay.

274
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,600
Okay, Pork Ribs.

275
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:37,970
Okay.

276
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,260
Chu Chu.

277
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,470
What do you want to eat?

278
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,810
Squirrel-Shaped Mandarin Fish.

279
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:43,650
-Do you have it?
-Yes.

280
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,610
-One, please.
-Okay.

281
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,570
What else?

282
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,850
A portion of.

283
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,650
Pork Ribs please.

284
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,620
Thank you.

285
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:53,980
Chu Chu likes spicy food.

286
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,150
One more.

287
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,990
Diced Chicken with Chili Pepper.

288
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,680
We're leaving.

289
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,340
Do you also like Yun Shu?

290
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,020
I like you, too.

291
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,310
It seems to be true.

292
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,520
Stop guessing.

293
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,950
You were like this when at school.

294
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,820
You tell the most serious thing
with jokes.

295
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,880
They make a fine couple.

296
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,010
I wish them happiness.

297
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,470
I don't believe Si Nian
can really fall in love with Yun Shu.

298
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,480
They're so different
from each other.

299
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,990
Actions speak louder than words.

300
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,640
Time will test everything.

301
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,540
The two of them are a good match.

302
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,130
Let's not disturb them.

303
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,150
By the way.

304
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,450
I didn't drive today.

305
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,570
I'll call a cab for you.

306
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,600
Do you know about their
contractual relationship?

307
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,760
[Restaurant Yun Hai]

308
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,280
Contractual relationship?

309
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,969
[Going along with your intention
is a promise I made to myself]

310
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,530
Interesting.

311
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:35,919
Mei.

312
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:36,980
You wanted to see me?

313
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,400
Yes.

314
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:41,150
I've recommended your work

315
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,480
to the editor of

316
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,910
the publishing house.

317
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,750
If the editor of the publishing house

318
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,000
chooses your work,

319
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,330
your comics will be serialized overseas.

320
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,250
Mei,

321
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,970
I'll definitely work hard.

322
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,110
All the best.

323
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:55,600
In the future,

324
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:56,620
you should make every issue

325
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,230
perfect like this.

326
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,220
Contractual relationship?

327
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,900
You chose a good topic.

328
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,610
It will surely attract attention.

329
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,120
Contractual relationship?

330
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:05,780
Look.

331
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,170
the text by Si Hua Nian
is great too.

332
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,380
Look at this line.

333
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,340
"Going along with your intention

334
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,490
is a promise I made to myself."

335
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,230
Where is she?

336
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,080
That girl.

337
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,530
I ordered a Cold Brew for you.

338
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,820
Thank you.

339
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,110
This is the comic book I received

340
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,480
three days ago.

341
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,710
[Going along with your intention
is a promise I made to myself]

342
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,700
Si Nian and you

343
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,200
have a contractual relationship?

344
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,940
Such a relationship

345
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,610
is just a way for us
to get acquainted.

346
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,500
It doesn't mean anything anymore.

347
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,960
Is it because of grandpa?

348
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:54,750
Yun Shu.

349
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,290
There’s still a long way to go.

350
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,570
Have you seriously considered

351
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,970
the future of the two of you?

352
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,350
A successful marriage

353
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,650
requires sharing the same
world view, goals

354
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,640
and life sentiments.

355
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,640
Can you answer my three questions?

356
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,030
I think

357
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,560
life is good.

358
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,580
Every single day is
worth cherishing for me.

359
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,630
Mr Zhang and I have the same goal.

360
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,980
We made an agreement together

361
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,150
to take good care of grandpa

362
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,600
and live happily together.

363
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,280
As for life sentiment,

364
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,780
meeting Mr Zhang

365
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,890
is the happiest thing in my life.

366
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,130
You have your charm.

367
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,330
But I know Si Nian's world view

368
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,030
is that infinite
possibilities in the world

369
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,620
comes down to one of
the mathematical forms.

370
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,900
I also know

371
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,610
Si Nian's life goal

372
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,380
is to win the Fields Medal

373
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,280
before 35 years old.

374
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,810
And I have the same life sentiment
as him.

375
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,240
We both think

376
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,570
people are born lonely.

377
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,560
Chu Chu.

378
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,780
If it's as you said,

379
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,260
why didn't you fall in love
with each other?

380
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,720
I called you out this time

381
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,600
because I want to tell you something.

382
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,260
I can take the initiative
to let the agency

383
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,330
cancel the contract.

384
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,290
You don't have to.

385
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,090
I thought you'd mind.

386
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,690
After all, you’re still young.

387
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:04,900
I'm afraid you

388
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,580
can't make clear the boundary
between life

389
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,070
and feelings.

390
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,790
Thank you for worrying about me.

391
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,200
Chu Chu.

392
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,590
Indeed, you’re older than me

393
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,100
and have richer experience than me,

394
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,000
but I hope you can know.

395
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,550
I’m Zhang Si Nian's wife.

396
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,440
I'm already a married woman.

397
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,670
Of course, I'm very clear

398
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,930
about the boundary between life and work.

399
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,800
Happy cooperation.

400
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,040
Happy cooperation.

401
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:53,360
[Inpatient]

402
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,450
Nurse.

403
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,550
You tried so many times.

404
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,250
Sorry.

405
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,570
Your mother has thin blood vessels.

406
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,630
I'll try again.

407
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,550
Try?

408
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,130
So you're practising with my mum's hand?

409
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,420
-Sorry.
-Don't inject if you can't.

410
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,380
-Sorry.
-My mum's hand is swollen.

411
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,330
-Lin Nuo.
-Alright. It's okay.

412
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,350
Sorry.

413
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,550
Xia Lin, change the needle.

414
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,390
Granny, let me inject for you, okay?

415
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,360
Okay.

416
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,690
Granny.

417
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,290
At the first glance, I know

418
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,940
you enjoy the happiness of being
accompanied by sons and daughters.

419
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,410
Thank you.

420
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,910
Okay.

421
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,450
[Sorry. The subscriber you dialled is]

422
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,730
[Dormitory]

423
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,050
[is unavailable right now.]

424
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,910
[Please try again later.]

425
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,230
Why hasn't that stupid Lin Nuo
contacted me?

426
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,910
Or I'll do it myself.

427
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,870
Let me do this.

428
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,950
It's alright.

429
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,280
It’s a small cut.

430
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,900
It was all my fault.

431
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,230
It's not your fault. I was careless.

432
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,070
I don't know what was wrong with me.

433
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,980
What are you doing?

434
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,280
Yi Yi.

435
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,700
Lin Nuo.

436
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,110
So this is the reason
why you broke up with me?

437
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,370
No, what are you saying?

438
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,380
This woman.

439
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,100
You wanted to break up with me
because of her, right?

440
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,660
You're overthinking.

441
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,830
I was wondering why you didn't
come looking for me.

442
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,850
It turns out you've got new girlfriend.

443
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,170
Lin Nuo.

444
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,440
I'll go first.

445
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,090
Why are you leaving?

446
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,710
Let's make it clear together.

447
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,750
Gao Zhi Yi.

448
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,550
What are you doing?

449
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,030
This is a hospital.
Can you keep your voice down?

450
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,810
You know you're in a hospital?

451
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,500
What did you do just now?

452
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,720
We did nothing at all.

453
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,820
Let me explain.

454
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,750
I saw you. Why are you trying to deny it?

455
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,700
Lin Nuo, be a man and admit it.

456
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,560
Gao Zhi Yi, you’re always like this.

457
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,970
You always blame others for the mistakes.

458
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,230
Are you really faultless?

459
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,290
Can't you reflect on yourself for once?

460
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,950
Okay.

461
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,820
You want to break up with me, right?

462
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,050
Fine with me.

463
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,780
Mr Zhang.

464
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,410
How do you view the world?

465
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,910
Why did you suddenly ask me that?

466
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,830
I just suddenly want to know.

467
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,250
The world is just one of the
mathematical forms

468
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,280
among an infinite number of posibilities.

469
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,130
That means

470
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,330
there're infinite
possibilities for mathematics.

471
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:38,570
Stop.

472
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,180
Don't explain.

473
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,070
I can't understand even if
you explain more.

474
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,710
-Then I'll ask you another question.
-Okay.

475
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,000
What are your plans for the future?

476
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,460
Win the Fields Medal

477
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,960
before 35 years old.

478
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,020
Then,

479
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,410
what's your life’s insight?

480
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,510
It’s my greatest luck

481
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,540
to have met you.

482
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,350
Answer it for me.

483
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,900
It's Shen Lan.

484
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,660
Answer it.

485
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,020
[Hello, Professor Zhang.]

486
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,310
Miss Shen.

487
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,370
I just heard that

488
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,880
you want to quit that project?

489
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,340
Miss Shen.

490
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,300
I’ve reported it to the

491
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,760
dean this afternoon

492
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,850
I'll quit

493
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,000
this project.

494
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,630
Why so sudden?

495
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,500
If you quit now,

496
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,620
all your efforts

497
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,080
will be wasted.

498
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,900
[How about you]

499
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,450
[think it over again?]

500
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,190
[Is it because of Yun Shu?]

501
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,580
[Are you worried]

502
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,500
[that working with Miss Lin]

503
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,360
[will make Yun Shu uncomfortable?]

504
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,460
Miss Shen,

505
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,530
I have something else to do.

506
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,540
I'm hanging up.

507
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,030
Did something happen?

508
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,600
Nothing.

509
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,940
We can continue cooking.

510
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,610
Is it because of me?

511
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,230
Don't overthink.

512
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,780
It has nothing to do with you.

513
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,910
I'll continue to wash the vegetables.

514
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,870
Okay.

515
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,380
Why are you

516
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,970
packing up my luggage now?

517
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,680
Just now

518
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,830
I just called Miss Shen Lan.

519
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,740
You rejected this project

520
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,180
for fear that

521
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,970
going to the retreat
with Chu Chu

522
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,450
would make me upset,

523
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,410
right?

524
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,340
I'm just too tired recently.

525
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,250
And I want spend more time

526
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,630
with Grandpa.

527
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,820
Si Nian,

528
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,410
I'm not that childish.

529
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,360
I want to be the better half of you,

530
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,000
not your stumbling block.

531
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,100
Although

532
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,250
I don't quite understand your world view,

533
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,380
but at least

534
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,990
I can try my best

535
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,350
for your life plan.

536
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,180
It's so late.

537
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,800
You have an appointment?

538
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:58,930
No.

539
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,370
Don't cry.

540
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,910
Yun Shu.

541
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,650
Yi Yi.

542
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,460
This time, I really

543
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,170
broke up with Lin Nuo.

544
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:21,890
Come on.

545
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,200
What's going on with you two?

546
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,060
Lin Nuo is a jerk.

547
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,410
He actually cheated on me.

548
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,560
He cheated on you?

549
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,030
I don't think

550
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,910
that's the right description.

551
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,070
He indeed cheated on me.

552
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,820
He and Xia Lin...

553
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,580
They two...

554
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,340
Oh, Yi Yi, you poor thing.

555
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,340
There's more.

556
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,780
Would you like some water?

557
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,710
Mr Zhang.

558
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,140
I'm a little thirsty.

559
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,020
Can you get me a glass of water?

560
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,610
Let me get it.

561
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,780
Let me go.

562
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,080
Stay with her.

563
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,100
Thank you.

564
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,510
Yi Yi.

565
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,830
Is there any misunderstanding

566
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,900
between you?

567
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,420
Not at all.

568
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,810
I saw him

569
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,600
was holding the girl's hand.

570
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,130
They held hands?

571
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,660
You have no idea

572
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,830
how hard he scolded me.

573
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,040
Lin Nuo did?

574
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,000
I can't imagine it.

575
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,680
You're still defending him.

576
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,260
Not at all.

577
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,420
Lin Nuo is just a playboy.

578
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,140
He's a love rat.

579
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,350
Yeah. Love rat!

580
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,600
I'll scold him later.

581
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,630
Your eyes are swollen.

582
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,830
Yun Shu.

583
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,840
Can I sleep here

584
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,080
tonight?

585
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:05,590
I don't want to go back
to the dormitory.

586
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,910
I might die

587
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,110
if I'm by myself.

588
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,520
Miss Gao.

589
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,480
Have a glass of water.

590
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,400
Can I sleep here, Mr Zhang?

591
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,260
Yi Yi, I'll sleep with you tonight.

592
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,430
Don't cry.

593
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,570
We'll share the bad, okay?

594
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,110
Drink the water.

595
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,100
Your voice is hoarse.

596
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,200
Yun Shu.

597
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,100
How long do you think
they've been together?

598
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,360
But I still think

599
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,990
Lin Nuo

600
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,110
wouldn't have done that.

601
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,630
But that's what he did.

602
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,960
He's gone too far, right?

603
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,160
Yun Shu, will you sleep with me?

604
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,790
Dear, I'll go back when
Yi Yi falls asleep.

605
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,410
Faking sleep?

606
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,280
Am I disturbing you?

607
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,570
No.

608
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,130
Don't say that.

609
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,680
It's... It's about my work.

610
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,800
Let me finish replying.

611
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,720
Are you tired?

612
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:03,690
How about

613
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,030
we just go to sleep?

614
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,310
Where are you going?

615
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,390
I think if it's a little crowded.

616
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,230
So I want to

617
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,700
move to this side a little bit.

618
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,460
It's not crowded.

619
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,670
Okay then.

620
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,800
Let's sleep.

621
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,450
[Yun Shu.]

622
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,910
[Okay. A moment please.]

623
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,270
Yun Shu.

624
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,890
There's plenty of space.

625
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,300
My right arm is a little numb.

626
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,720
So I sat up

627
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,730
to stretch a little.

628
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,040
Come here.

629
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,570
Okay.

630
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,529
Lan.

631
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:53,839
Someone is here to see you.

632
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,839
Who is it?

633
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,500
Hello.

634
00:33:00,589 --> 00:33:01,850
I'm Lu Yu's agent.

635
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:02,700
You can call me Xi Xi.

636
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,759
Hello, I'm Yun Lan.

637
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:06,759
Yun Lan.

638
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,520
I know about

639
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:09,750
what happened to you and Lu Yu.

640
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,240
Since you're family,

641
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,880
I'll cut to the chase.

642
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,390
[Case file]

643
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,670
Here.

644
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,590
Take a look.

645
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:31,710
[Lawyer's Letter]

646
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,240
I believe you should know

647
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,180
the name, Han Rong, right?

648
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,570
Han Rong sued Lu Yu

649
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,060
for intentional injury?

650
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,060
What's going on?
