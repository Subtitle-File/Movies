[Episode 22]

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,260
And then I said to Mr Zhang

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,450
that I love him.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,190
And then?

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,770
Then Mr Zhang

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,560
said he loved me too.

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,210
And?

10
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:28,220
And...

11
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,990
And...

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,300
And we went to sleep.

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,929
Mr Zhang is really quiet inside.

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,340
I think

15
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:41,850
he doesn't bother to think about these.

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,020
There’re still errors in the calculation

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,250
in the mathematical samples.

18
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,020
This is really urgent.

19
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,420
Okay, okay, I got it.

20
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,320
I see.

21
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,480
Take a break.

22
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,970
Everybody, take a break

23
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,580
and drink coffee.

24
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,750
Thanks, Miss. Lin.

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,830
You're welcome.

26
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,040
Take a break

27
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,010
and have a cup of coffee.

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,170
Okay, thank you.

29
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,050
Why is Professor Zhang's coffee

30
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,830
is different from ours.

31
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,150
Professor Zhang is picky

32
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,040
and has many requirements.

33
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,800
You know about his habit.

34
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,150
His coffee must be made specially.

35
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,600
Come on, enjoy coffee.

36
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,440
Thank you.

37
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,410
Okay.

38
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,830
It's hot.

39
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,240
All right.

40
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,870
Let's call it a day.

41
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,490
You should sort out all the files later

42
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,350
and sent me.

43
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:44,620
Okay.

44
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,590
Thanks for your hard work.

45
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,760
Okay. It's okay!

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,960
Remember to give it to me again

47
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,640
when finish calculating.

48
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,610
Okay.

49
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:51,429
Okay.

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:51,700
Thank you

51
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,870
I'll go first.

52
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,179
Okay.

53
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,150
We're leaving first.

54
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,150
You should be tired, too.

55
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,740
Take a rest

56
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,710
I'm leaving.

57
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,370
Si Nian.

58
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,680
I want to talk to you.

59
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,010
Grandpa.

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,550
Grandpa.

61
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,530
Yun Shu.

62
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,700
It's alright.

63
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,590
When one gets old,

64
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:31,230
he'd always encounter many accidents.

65
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,310
Don't worry about it.

66
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,710
Dr Zhang,

67
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,760
what's wrong with grandpa?

68
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,070
Is it serious?

69
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,660
No big deal.

70
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,190
Spend more time with him.

71
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,020
Okay, thanks for your hard work.

72
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,020
Grandpa.

73
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,640
Have a good rest.

74
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,440
I'll always be with you.

75
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,500
Where's Si Nian?

76
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,200
Si Nian went to retreat because of work.

77
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,610
Chu Chu.

78
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,270
I'm married now

79
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,990
and I have my wife.

80
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,900
So your questions

81
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,420
for Yun Shu

82
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,030
were quite offensive.

83
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,870
But you’re in a contractual relationship.

84
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,920
And you did this for grandpa...

85
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,920
But

86
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,530
we changed contractual relationship

87
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,990
to a real marriage.

88
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,350
And I really love her.

89
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,260
You used to

90
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,670
focus on data only.

91
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,700
You only believed data

92
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,700
and the future inferred by the data.

93
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,150
Then can you tell me

94
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,259
if you're sure enough

95
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,780
to always be happy with Yun Shu?

96
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,210
From what I know about you,

97
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,640
the gap between you two

98
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,810
will leads to a long running-in period

99
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,580
for your love and marriage.

100
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,610
You're aware of this, aren’t you?

101
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:02,690
But these factors

102
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,530
aren't what both of us

103
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,320
to prove.

104
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,450
Grandpa, wait a minute.

105
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,800
It's Si Nian.

106
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,230
Yun Shu, did you just call me?

107
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,850
Yes.

108
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,070
What's the matter?

109
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,310
Nothing important.

110
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,780
I was in the studio just now

111
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,080
I'm a little busy.

112
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,980
I'm hanging up.

113
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,920
Grandpa.

114
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:48,070
Why don't you let me tell Si Nian?

115
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,230
No big deal.

116
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,940
Don't disturb Si Nian.

117
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:56,940
He needs to work.

118
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,450
And

119
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,100
it's enough for

120
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,050
you are here with grandpa.

121
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,050
Is it really okay?

122
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,560
Graduate defence season

123
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,470
is coming soon.

124
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,080
Why did he suddenly go to retreat?

125
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,860
Actually, I don't know either.

126
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,510
Si Nian said

127
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,280
the investigation time report of.

128
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,470
Lin Chu Chu's company was advanced.

129
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,900
So

130
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,430
maybe they're

131
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,460
making every endeavour during retreat.

132
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,690
They just work.

133
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,710
Si Nian and Lin Chu Chu

134
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,590
are working together.

135
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,890
You're worried about that, right?

136
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,710
I believe him.

137
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,870
And

138
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,180
what is likely to happen between them

139
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,050
should have happened a long time ago.

140
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,430
Yun Shu, you're smart and generous.

141
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,320
In fact, you don't have to worry.

142
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,420
Because they're so much alike.

143
00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:00,040
They're like two parallel lines

144
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,270
and never intersect with each other.

145
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,310
They're elites

146
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,130
with common interests

147
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,540
and they've known
each other for a long time,

148
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,420
but if they're together,

149
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,650
they can only

150
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,590
become like-minded friends.

151
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,110
Grandpa.

152
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,260
You’re really good at judging people.

153
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,970
Of course!

154
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,340
The first time I saw you,

155
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,880
I knew

156
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,880
Si Nian and you

157
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,420
were a perfect match.

158
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,120
Really?

159
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,950
When did Grandpa ever lie to you?

160
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:53,850
Yun Shu.

161
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,310
Lin Nuo.

162
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,220
You're off work?

163
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,800
Gao Zhi Yi told you to here?

164
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,930
Didn't she tell you

165
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,230
come to complain?

166
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,580
You're overthinking.

167
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,750
I came to see grandpa today.

168
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,270
Grandpa, he is in hospital again?

169
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,380
Is he alright?

170
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,780
I hope so.

171
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,010
Lin Nuo.

172
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,880
I forgot my mobile phone.

173
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,650
I'm so dumb.

174
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,620
Thank you.

175
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,080
Bye.

176
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,050
Bye.

177
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,220
Lin Nuo,

178
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,410
is there anything

179
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,200
or anybody

180
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,910
distracted you?

181
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,690
Alright!

182
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,990
Yi Yi told you

183
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,990
I have a new love, didn't she?

184
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,950
Isn't it true?

185
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,320
Of course not.

186
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,420
My breakup with Yi Yi

187
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,900
is totally our own problem.

188
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,780
If you two are doing it because
of Gu Xiao,

189
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,130
you're overthinking.

190
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,080
Our breakup

191
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:44,940
has nothing to do with

192
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,320
anybody. You know that?

193
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,680
You know me.

194
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:48,680
I never thought of

195
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:49,540
breaking up with Yi Yi.

196
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,300
Then why do you two become like this?

197
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,280
I think,

198
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,840
in our relationship,

199
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,300
I was too meek.

200
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,590
She and I have never been reciprocal.

201
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,780
Reciprocal?

202
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,750
Lin Nuo, you know.

203
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,440
Yi Yi didn't mean that.

204
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,690
But Yun Shu, we also known
each other for a long time.

205
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,240
You know

206
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,760
I wasn't like this before.

207
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,480
But since I met Gao Zhi Yi,

208
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,690
I'm completely different from myself.

209
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,060
You know?

210
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,030
When a boy and a girl are together,

211
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,230
they should change for each other,

212
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,190
right?

213
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,740
No, I don't think so.

214
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,700
I think a good romantic relationship

215
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,180
shouldn't be like this.

216
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,370
Even if you like somebody
and change for him,

217
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,370
it should be happy and relaxing process.

218
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,160
But I'm not happy at all now.

219
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,410
All right,

220
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,540
I think there's

221
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,550
no use going like this for you two.

222
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,700
You should find a chance

223
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,040
to meet with her

224
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,190
and talk with her.

225
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,550
That won't be necessary.

226
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,710
We fight

227
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,840
as we see each other.

228
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,110
Lin Nuo,

229
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,590
can you drive?

230
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,840
I can.

231
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,080
Yun Shu,

232
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,270
didn't you ask me to come and help?

233
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,580
Why did you call him?

234
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,160
I don't know either.

235
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,770
I didn't know you'd come?

236
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,800
Yun Shu, did you do it on purpose?

237
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:14,770
Come on,

238
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,580
I really have something urgent today

239
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,080
and I need your help,

240
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
but if they're together.

241
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,780
I don't talk to jerks.

242
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,330
This is weird.

243
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,510
Don't you only love jerks?

244
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,330
Yeah, I used to have "eye problems".

245
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,440
That's terrible. You need a cure then

246
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,940
or you'll be blind.

247
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,730
Okay! Would you please
find a handsome doctor

248
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,900
in your hospital for me

249
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,440
to cure my perennial illness?

250
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,410
No.

251
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,810
The doctors in our hospital

252
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,690
have noble medical ethics

253
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,850
and aren't qualified for you.

254
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,820
Stop.

255
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,140
Stop fighting!

256
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,420
Yun Shu, let me tell you something.

257
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,250
Someone

258
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,570
just likes to covet other
people's boyfriends.

259
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,360
This time

260
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,810
we must return home in triumph.

261
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,660
We must not let people like Lin Chu Chu

262
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,190
get any chance to
interrupt your relationship.

263
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,130
It's not that serious, is it?

264
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,840
Of course it is.

265
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,890
You can ask Lin Nuo.

266
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,310
He has the most say.

267
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,850
Darn.

268
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,140
Nuts.

269
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,100
What?

270
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:21,900
Yun Shu.

271
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,830
Is this the right way?

272
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,260
Check the navigation.
I've never been there either.

273
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,670
I'm so sorry.

274
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,720
We can't reveal the
privacy of our guests.

275
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,610
How can it be privacy?

276
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,640
I told you he's my husband.

277
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,800
I come here for my husband.

278
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,430
What's wrong with it?

279
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,160
You can call him

280
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,680
and let him pick you up.

281
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,600
If he answers my phone,

282
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,340
why do I bother to ask you for a favour?

283
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,870
I'm really sorry.

284
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:00,880
I have a photo with him.

285
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:01,740
Let me show you

286
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,190
I'm really sorry.

287
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,020
Why are you like this?

288
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,660
I got married after
graduating from college.

289
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,960
I can do nothing but housework.

290
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,940
If my husband is taken away,

291
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,100
what can I live on?

292
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,290
I have to raise two children.

293
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,190
Yi Yi, let's forget about it.

294
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,110
Men nowadays are unreliable

295
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,810
they hanker after women

296
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,710
or chased by women.

297
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,010
They don't take the initiative
and don't take responsibility either.

298
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,890
My life is so miserable.

299
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,580
I can't tell them the room number.

300
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,910
They don't take the initiative
and don't take responsibility either.

301
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,450
Personally, I am very sympathetic
to what happened to you.

302
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,160
But the hotel has rules,

303
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,950
so there's nothing we can do.

304
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,730
Yun Shu, what should I do?

305
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,780
My husband is going to be taken away.

306
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,850
When we leave,

307
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,830
you can go to the first
floor of the East Building.

308
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,590
Thank you. That's very kind of you.

309
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,400
Coming.

310
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
How about let's go?

311
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,770
If you're here to argue with me,

312
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,190
I don't think it's necessary.

313
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,820
Actually,

314
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,250
there're other things I want to ask you.

315
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,250
Yun Shu.

316
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,870
How about you call him again?

317
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,270
Is that Mr Zhang?

318
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,720
Go! Go! Go!

319
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,620
Si Nian.

320
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,840
I really can't figure out

321
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,260
why you like Yun Shu.

322
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,850
Yun Shu.

323
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,920
Come here.

324
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,330
Come back.

325
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,100
Come here. Come here.

326
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,190
Come over here!

327
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,440
After I came back, I also counted

328
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,360
the times we get along with each other

329
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,250
since I met Yun Shu for the first time

330
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,910
to the building of our
contractual relationship

331
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,340
and to this business trip.

332
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,700
The number of times we get along
with each other during this period

333
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,880
is 821 times.

334
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,130
In the process of contact,

335
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,210
the percentage she showed happiness to me

336
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,620
is 83.33 percent.

337
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,300
12 percent of which

338
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,000
wasn't caused by me.

339
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,390
When she's with me,

340
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,660
she's generally

341
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,750
happy.

342
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,160
I also calculated

343
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,830
my feelings about Yun Shu.

344
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,260
Happiness and joy

345
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,020
accounts for

346
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,330
73.33 percent.

347
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,530
So the data of the two of
us get along with each other

348
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,430
is quite big

349
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,980
among general couples.

350
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,710
Sorry!

351
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,810
I used

352
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,660
the relevant data in the laboratory

353
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,670
without your permission.

354
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,440
Why are you suddenly so serious

355
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,550
about this kind of thing?

356
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,480
Didn't you tell me this afternoon

357
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,610
that my answer didn't seem

358
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,560
out of rigorous professor of mathematics?

359
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,660
I'm...

360
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,650
I'm really hard to imagine

361
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,290
why would you be with a girl

362
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,380
whose personality is
entirely different from you.

363
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:06,670
As you know,

364
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,190
the reason why I came back this time

365
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,140
was to cure my grandpa.

366
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,750
Grandpa's illness made me

367
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,160
feel so lost.

368
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,630
I've always

369
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:17,790
hoped everything

370
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,400
can be under control and planned well.

371
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,689
I don't want anything

372
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,429
to go out of control.

373
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,679
Until that day,

374
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:27,600
a person who had
diametrically opposite character

375
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,110
with me came into my life.

376
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,230
She reconciled

377
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,900
herself to her situation.

378
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,350
She was totally an "almost girl".

379
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,560
She changed me.

380
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,710
At the very beginning,

381
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,950
I didn't admit it.

382
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,000
Until recently I started studying

383
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,870
my relationship with her and I found

384
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,480
she gave me company.

385
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,100
Why did

386
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,830
you help me?

387
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,550
We were all alone at that time.

388
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,360
But I noticed that

389
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,880
you were very much like me.

390
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,740
We had the same life experience

391
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,120
and same character.

392
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,710
Even

393
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,240
the similar future life planning.

394
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,430
So Chu Chu.

395
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,510
I’ve always regarded
you as my best friend.

396
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,870
Am I not excellent or

397
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,770
good enough?

398
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,770
No.

399
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,690
Two people who are too similar

400
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,380
is just like two parallel lines.

401
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,130
It's hard to intersect.

402
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,910
So Chu Chu,

403
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,900
I really hope you can find a man

404
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,900
who complements you

405
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,590
with intersections.

406
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,440
Just like Yun Shu and I do.

407
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,670
Although we have
different starting points

408
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,190
and direction of life,

409
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,960
it's like climbing a mountain.

410
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,420
I’m willing to wait for her
halfway up the mountain.

411
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,360
Take her hand

412
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,180
and to be with her.

413
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,480
I’ve also learned a truth recently.

414
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,340
Enjoying scenery alone

415
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,550
is worse than doing the same
thing with someone you like.

416
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,020
So you never

417
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,170
like me?

418
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,900
Maybe I didn't

419
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,020
know myself then.

420
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,930
It may be just like that

421
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,960
when I met Yun Shu.

422
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,150
Don't lie if you can't.

423
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:04,970
Alright,

424
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,060
I get it.

425
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,190
Can I

426
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,510
hug you?

427
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,780
Think of it as the last farewell.

428
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,770
I already have someone I want to hug.

429
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,790
Yun Shu.

430
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,490
Mr Zhang.

431
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,880
We came with Yun Shu.

432
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,050
Mr Zhang,

433
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,460
I didn't mean to eavesdrop on you two.

434
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,580
Actually, I was going to...

435
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,680
What else did you want to say just now?

436
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,960
I was just about to say

437
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,980
I went to the hospital this morning

438
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,590
to see grandpa.

439
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,260
What's wrong with grandpa?

440
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,150
Grandpa is in a good state.

441
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,230
That's good.

442
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,660
It's so late. How can we get back?

443
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,710
I...

444
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,020
I hailed a cab.

445
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,720
Don't you have anything to tell me?

446
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,720
Does it work if I say?

447
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,090
Lin Nuo.

448
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,900
You're strange.

449
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,540
It's not like you before.

450
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,420
Maybe

451
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,860
this is the real me.

452
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,230
What do you mean?

453
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,830
Here comes the cab.

454
00:20:58,810 --> 00:20:59,910
Won't you go?

455
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,150
I go alone.

456
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,350
Mister driver,

457
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,630
please drive her to Zheng Ben University.

458
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,570
Okay, no problem.

459
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,330
Thank you.

460
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,300
It's okay.

461
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,040
Surprise!

462
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,390
I flew over when I finished working.

463
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,190
Hold on.

464
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,180
Hold on.

465
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,760
What's the matter?

466
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,070
Tell me about it.

467
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,890
What's going on?

468
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,630
Xi Xi came to see you?

469
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,190
I told her many times

470
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,160
not to tell you.

471
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,360
I can't believe

472
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,260
she didn't listen to me at all

473
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,070
I'll go to him.

474
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,030
You can't escape.

475
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,230
You have to make it clear to me.

476
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,510
Honey.

477
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,830
Listen.

478
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,140
Don't be angry.

479
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,490
It's you!

480
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,580
What a coincidence!

481
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,490
What? What?

482
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,630
I’m warning you.

483
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,110
Stay away from Yun Lan in the future.

484
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,340
I won't let you go

485
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,700
if you scheme to harm her again.

486
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:05,850
Hear that?

487
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,660
Yes!

488
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,170
Hear that?

489
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,140
Don't punch me.

490
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,610
Yes!

491
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,790
[Replay]

492
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,080
I didn't really hit him.

493
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,300
I just scared him.

494
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,600
You are a celebrity.

495
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,950
If it gets worse,

496
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,710
the impact on your career is fatal.

497
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,910
So now you're blaming me.

498
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,720
I'm not blaming you.

499
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,150
I'm worried about you.

500
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,370
It's not worthwhile

501
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,910
for your career to be affected

502
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,170
for such a man.

503
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,070
I

504
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,630
am willing do everything for you

505
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,440
I'll find Han Rong.

506
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,410
Stop!

507
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,100
You can't go to the scum.

508
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,800
Can you stop being wilful?

509
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,800
Yun Lan

510
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,030
I'll handle this matter myself.

511
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,220
You just stay out of it.

512
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,390
Mr Zhang.

513
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,080
Grandpa gets better today.

514
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,080
How about you go back first?

515
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,530
I can take care of

516
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,480
grandpa by myself.

517
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,990
Don't worry.

518
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,190
Mr Kobayashi.

519
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,250
Is it really the Mr Kobayashi?

520
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,430
Yeah.

521
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:09,010
He said your painting
style is unique and novel

522
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,680
and different from others.

523
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,410
I have a feeling that

524
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,340
my heart is going to jump out.

525
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,020
And now I think

526
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,320
my life is so glorious.

527
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,770
I never thought

528
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,610
my work would be

529
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,300
evaluated by my idol one day.

530
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,390
Don't get carried away.

531
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,390
I haven't finished speaking yet.

532
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,530
Could it be...

533
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,050
But...

534
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,260
Don't be nervous.

535
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,740
In fact,

536
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,580
Mr Kobayashi's studio

537
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,820
is recruiting new assistants.

538
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,180
He sent you an invitation

539
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,500
by the publishing house.

540
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,470
He wants you to be his new assistant.

541
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,780
Me?

542
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,680
His new assistant?

543
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:48,890
I’m not free to joke with you.

544
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm busy.

545
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,630
I don't want you to go yet.

546
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,600
Then

547
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,480
how long will it take?

548
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,180
A three-year contract period.

549
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,170
That's great.

550
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,830
What's there to hesitate about?

551
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,730
I have to give you a
celebration ceremony.

552
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,400
You have to

553
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,350
send me the serial of next week.

554
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,240
No problem.

555
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,750
Hello, Editor Gao.

556
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,480
Are you free next week?

557
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,240
What's up?

558
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,100
Yun Shu's work

559
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,210
has caught the attention of
the overseas god of cartoonists,

560
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,660
Mr Kobayashi.

561
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,990
It's also our company's honour.

562
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,750
So

563
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,980
I'm going to hold a celebration for her.

564
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,940
Her work was once

565
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,750
blessed and supported by your talents.

566
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,600
So you must join us.

567
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,960
Okay, I'll definitely go.

568
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,800
May I ask

569
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,190
how long does it take Yun Shu
to go abroad this time?

570
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,260
Three years.

571
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,830
OK, then I'll see you next week.

572
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,080
Okay, thank you.

573
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,200
Lan,

574
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,280
do you think I should go or not?

575
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,770
The reason why you want to go is...

576
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,790
Mr Kobayashi.

577
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,250
He’s my idol since I was a child.

578
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,570
If I can become his assistant,

579
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,450
I can realize my dream.

580
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,270
The reason why you don't want to go is...

581
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,470
The contract period is three years.

582
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,520
I can't bear to be separated
from Mr Zhang for so long.

583
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,350
Dream

584
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,650
and love.

585
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,170
They form the most
difficult thing to decide

586
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,120
in life.

587
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,150
You have to figure it out for yourself.

588
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,960
Lan,

589
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,020
if it were you,

590
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,920
how would you choose?

591
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,590
Yun Shu.

592
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,620
My opinion

593
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,410
has no reference value

594
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,110
for you.

595
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,880
Hello, Dr Zhang.

596
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,670
Academician Zhang's
treatment plan has come out.

597
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,990
Come over if you have time.

598
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,690
Dr Zhang,

599
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,110
Please just tell me the truth.

600
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,740
The cancer cells

601
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,690
have spread to the bones.

602
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,840
Your grandpa has also known about it.

603
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,850
I was going to tell you.

604
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,070
But he didn't agree.

605
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,930
He wants to be with you two.

606
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,560
Aren't there really

607
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,590
any other treatments?

608
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,290
With the current treatment method,

609
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,520
how long can

610
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,310
my grandpa live?

611
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,390
Two months.

612
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,630
Two months.

613
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,240
Si Nian

614
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,790
I'm here to see grandpa.

615
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,330
Thank you.

616
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,030
I contacted

617
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,620
Dr Smith from overseas before.

618
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,770
He’s an authority in
the field of lymphoma.

619
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,860
Today, the overseas
clinic finally gave a reply.

620
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,320
Here's the information. Read it.

621
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,160
Chu Chu,

622
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,450
I would like to thank you

623
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,420
on behalf of grandpa.

624
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,600
It's alright.

625
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:24,620
But grandpa

626
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,430
needs to go overseas.

627
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,720
Can you do that?

628
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,350
Go... Go overseas?

629
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,440
Of course.

630
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,660
Why don't you discuss it?

631
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,340
I'll come back to see
grandpa in a couple of days.

632
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,140
Okay.

633
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,470
Then I'll go first.

634
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,500
Thank you.

635
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,540
Yun Shu,

636
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,020
I forgot to congratulate you.

637
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:50,940
I heard

638
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,280
you received

639
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,230
an invitation from Mr Kobayashi's studio

640
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,670
to be his assistant.

641
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,950
You're going to Kobayashi's studio?
