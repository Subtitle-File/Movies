[Episode 23]

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,800
I've read about the treatment
in The Lancet.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,460
But it's still undergoing clinical trials.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,830
Official sanction has not yet been
given by relevant drug administrations.

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,190
Only the leading experts

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,210
of foreign clinics

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,690
get the prescription right.

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:32,790
Dr Zhang,

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,340
how is the efficacy?

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,520
According to

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,160
the current clinical trial data revealed,

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,760
it's efficacy is evident.

15
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,410
But most of the cured

16
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,290
were stage-III or earlier-stage patients

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,750
so there are limited data

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,240
of stage-IV patients
like your grandfather.

19
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,650
So,

20
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,260
what do you think?

21
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,460
It deserves a try.

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,440
To say the least,

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,350
though he can't totally recover,

24
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,580
his life can be prolonged.

25
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,300
It's still promising.

26
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,550
[You want to decline it?]

27
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,610
Yun Shu,

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,950
even experienced illustrators

29
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,070
even eager for this chance.

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,310
You are really lucky to have
this opportunity as a newbie.

31
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,840
So give it careful thought.

32
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:21,810
Mei,

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,260
I've made up my mind.

34
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,050
Do you know what you are giving up?

35
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,390
Of course, if you don't go
to Kobayashi Studio,

36
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,810
you can still be a cartoonist in China.

37
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,470
But if you go to Kobayashi Studio,

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,690
you may get some unexpected gains.

39
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,530
Something that you may
never get at home.

40
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,720
But...

41
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,940
I can't leave behind

42
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,310
those I love and

43
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,490
those who love me.

44
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,680
Forget it.

45
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,540
It doesn't matter what I say.

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,910
You're going to have
your final defense, right?

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,970
A week later.

48
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,300
Well,

49
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,020
don't decline me right away.

50
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,090
We can talk after your graduation.

51
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,060
What do you think?

52
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,570
Thanks, Mei.

53
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,550
I'll get back to work.

54
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,820
Go ahead.

55
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,900
Yun Shu.

56
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,670
If you need my help
with your family affairs,

57
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,640
just let me know.

58
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,570
I got rid of Lu Yu today

59
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,680
in order to talk with you alone.

60
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,170
Is it about Han Rong?

61
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,340
Yes.

62
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,570
Lu Yu doesn't want me to
get involved.

63
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,990
He will figure it out.

64
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,850
I won't come today

65
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,530
if he can work it out.

66
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:36,850
Guess what?

67
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,940
Lu Yu has been sidelined by the company.

68
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,830
If the lawsuit is not settled,

69
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,730
his career will be ruined.

70
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,300
Lan,

71
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,270
Mr Han is here and wants to see you.

72
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,490
Tell him

73
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,790
to come in in 10 minutes.

74
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,959
I will go.

75
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,040
Don't worry.

76
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,200
I'll figure it out.

77
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,750
I heard from Mr Liu

78
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,240
that you're resigning
as our company's legal advisor.

79
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,210
Yes.

80
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,440
I think I'm not fit for it.

81
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,310
You need a more competent advisor, Mr Han.

82
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,790
But I only trust you.

83
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,290
Trust should be mutual.

84
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,420
It can't be forced.

85
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,170
What if I insist for you to continue?

86
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,080
You must know about what happened

87
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:48,370
between Lu Yu and me.

88
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:49,500
If you can continue to be

89
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,610
our legal advisor,

90
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,209
maybe I can

91
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,440
cut him some slack.

92
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,500
Mr Han,

93
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,770
are you threatening me?

94
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,300
According to Article 226

95
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,820
of the Chinese Criminal Law,

96
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,020
one can be penalized

97
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,590
for forcing others to provide services

98
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,530
or to receive services

99
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,510
by threatening.

100
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,960
It's not a threat.

101
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,960
It's a compromise.

102
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,470
This USD stick contains

103
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,890
the footage of what happened that day.

104
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,590
It clearly shows Lu Yu and his action.

105
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,000
It also contains
the injury assessment done by

106
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,130
a professional institution.

107
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,110
Lu Yu will

108
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,820
lose in this case.

109
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,690
Now you're underestimating me.

110
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,370
I never look down on women,

111
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,600
let alone you.

112
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,380
I don't know the
entertainment industry well.

113
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,930
But I know people

114
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,300
will gossip in this circle.

115
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,970
The project has gotten the green light.

116
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,550
I'll go abroad

117
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,950
very soon.

118
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,930
Congratulations.

119
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,850
Also,

120
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,380
have a safe trip.

121
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,640
You've made up your mind?

122
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,180
Will you take grandpa
to get treatment abroad?

123
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,460
Grandpa is not in a good shape.

124
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,070
So I'm not sure

125
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,870
whether he can bear the

126
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,270
long journey.

127
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,500
Are you just caring about grandpa?

128
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,840
What do you mean?

129
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,960
I think you can't leave Yun Shu behind

130
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,840
and you don't want to part with her.

131
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,550
You think too much.

132
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,130
Though we're not in love,

133
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,100
you have to admit that

134
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,420
we're alike.

135
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,310
I can understand your hesitation.

136
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,030
But this chance

137
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,620
is grandpa's last hope.

138
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,170
I won't give up my grandpa.

139
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,390
This is my first time reading
such a thesis.

140
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,300
Is it not good enough?

141
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,280
It must be because you didn't do well,

142
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,630
so you stapled the four corners to

143
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,860
prevent me from reading it.

144
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,229
I... I'll open it.

145
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,760
Yun Shu,

146
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,410
what's wrong?

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,950
Why are you uneasy?

148
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,700
I've been thinking about

149
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,150
grandpa recently.

150
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,840
So,

151
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,570
I can't calm down.

152
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,690
Grandpa will be okay.

153
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,200
Rest assured.

154
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,690
I still think that

155
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,710
we should send grandpa overseas.

156
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,460
Maybe it's a slim hope,

157
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,440
but we shouldn't give it up.

158
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,200
You're going to have your final defense.

159
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,970
So forget about that first.

160
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,860
Be ready for your final defense.

161
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,610
As for grandpa's illness,

162
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,470
we'll find a better solution.

163
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,470
I'll pass my defense

164
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,280
with excellence.

165
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,860
Just don't be late.

166
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,970
What are you looking at?

167
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,110
You're preoccupied.

168
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,220
Nothing special.

169
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Some documents.

170
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,170
You gave up your diet?

171
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,800
Why do you eat so much junk food?

172
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,680
I can't be on diet every day.

173
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,280
What's the point of life then?

174
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,900
How about the law office?

175
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,350
You haven't been coming.

176
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,790
Are you giving up?

177
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,280
No.

178
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,480
The play I signed before

179
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,180
has some financial problem.

180
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,310
It is temporarily suspended.

181
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,330
Really?

182
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:52,510
What's going on?

183
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,740
Why are you so suspicious?

184
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,500
What is it?

185
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,220
[We're going to have a face-to-face
talk with Han Rong tomorrow.]

186
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,220
[At 2 p.m.]

187
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,480
Okay, got it.

188
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,620
[Don't worry.]

189
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,910
What's going on?

190
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,880
Nothing.

191
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,870
Okay, I got it.

192
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,100
Mr Zhang.

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,820
I knew it.

194
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,210
It wouldn't be smooth sailing.

195
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,740
Why?

196
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,720
It's law of the nature.

197
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,230
Let's go.

198
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,790
♫ You're a familiar stranger ♫

199
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,020
♫ Who keeps appearing before me ♫

200
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,300
♫ You're clumsy yet kind ♫

201
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,860
♫ Ringing the bell in my heart ♫

202
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,720
♫ You predict and plan ♫

203
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,380
♫ But you can't solve the problem
called love ♫

204
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,190
♫ Let me tell you, just hold my hand ♫

205
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,820
♫ Looking up, I see
the most perfect you ♫

206
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,010
Let's go.

207
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,280
♫ Close your eyes and feel me out,
the plain girl ♫

208
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,730
Mr Zhang!

209
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,350
You can do it!

210
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,730
♫ Time is ticking, too much romance
is is left behind ♫

211
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,750
Go get it, Mr Zhang!

212
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,880
Go for it.

213
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,150
Mr Zhang.

214
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,620
♫ You're here with me
as time passes us by ♫

215
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,160
Hello, teachers.

216
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,110
I'm sorry.

217
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,260
I got held up on the way.

218
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,390
I'm sorry.

219
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,160
I delayed a little time on my way.

220
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,340
I'll start my oral defense now.

221
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,700
Excuse me.

222
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,900
You've forfeited your defense.

223
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,760
Because you're late.

224
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,510
I shall now

225
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,700
start my oral defense.

226
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,310
My thesis is titled

227
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,000
the Analysis on the Restructure
of Statistics in Big Data Era.

228
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,740
To begin with, I'll discuss this

229
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,520
topic in 4 aspects,

230
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,010
from opportunities,
challenges and strategies...

231
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,380
♫ Looking up, I see
the most perfect you ♫

232
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,820
♫ Close your eyes and feel me out,
the plain girl ♫

233
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,180
♫ Time is ticking, too much romance
is is left behind ♫

234
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,940
♫ You're here with me
as time passes us by ♫

235
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,030
You're late, Yun Lan.

236
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,160
Come on.

237
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,080
Sit over here.

238
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,580
Yun Lan.

239
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,990
What's going on?

240
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,150
Yun Lan

241
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,960
is my attorney.

242
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,110
Okay. Since we're all here,
let's get it started.

243
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,530
What on earth is going on?

244
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,630
Why are you this scum's attorney?

245
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,320
Yun Lan.

246
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,810
Add libel to his list of offence.

247
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,890
Shut up.

248
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:14,960
Explain it.

249
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,520
Let's get down to business.

250
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:17,960
We can talk later.

251
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,300
No., tell me now.

252
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,830
Yun Lan is our company's legal advisor.

253
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,380
So there's nothing wrong with her

254
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,190
being my attorney.

255
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,750
Hold on.

256
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,360
Don't be so impulsive.

257
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,540
I'm not impulsive.

258
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,990
I just want to ask you one question.

259
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,440
Are you sure about taking this case?

260
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,410
Yes.

261
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,940
I'm taking this case because...

262
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,970
The company?

263
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,940
For money?

264
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,470
For your career and ambition?

265
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,420
That's what you think of me?

266
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,780
We're in a relationship.

267
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,230
But you never sacrificed anything for me.

268
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,100
No even the slightest bit
of compromise.

269
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,000
Yun Lan.

270
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,730
Sometimes, I really wonder
if you care about me at all.

271
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,130
Can we stop talking about this here?

272
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,360
Am I wrong?

273
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,410
Do you love me?

274
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,860
If you love me, just tell me right now.

275
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,750
Can you stop being childish?

276
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,590
-Come on.
-I'm being childish?

277
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,820
You know that I was slandered,

278
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,900
but you're on his side.

279
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,590
Is that supposed to be maturity?

280
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,620
Lu Yu.

281
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,230
I can explain it.

282
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,220
-It's not what you think.
-Save it, Yun Lan.

283
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,220
We're over.

284
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,200
It's always been my own wishful thinking
anyway.

285
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,020
So let's break up.

286
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,100
Saves you from having to say it.

287
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,510
Sorry to have troubled you.

288
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,590
Contact my lawyer

289
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,940
if you need anything.

290
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,820
Finally, after ups and downs,

291
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,090
my thesis got a pass.

292
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,770
Mr Zhang,

293
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,690
do you want to tell me anything?

294
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,340
Congratulations

295
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,170
on your thesis defense.

296
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,960
That's all?

297
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,770
Well, you don't have

298
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,410
to attend my classes anymore.

299
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,810
But I need to tell you something.

300
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,930
Our contact is coming to an end.

301
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,960
Do you want to

302
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:26,990
renew our contract

303
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,420
to be the real Mrs Zhang?

304
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,880
Yes, I do.

305
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,260
But,

306
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,960
I have one request.

307
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,420
Yes? What is it?

308
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,160
Can you wait for one year?

309
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,270
I want to go study

310
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,390
at Kobayashi Studio for a year.

311
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,490
Then you can take grandpa to go abroad

312
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,340
for treatment.

313
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,430
Are you okay with it?

314
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,310
Yes, that's fine.

315
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,180
Then?

316
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,669
Then?

317
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:19,190
Then, the groom

318
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,460
can kiss his bride.

319
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,740
And then...

320
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,460
what?

321
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,910
♫ Oh, hopeless people lost in the woods ♫

322
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,840
Then...

323
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,700
♫ The compass you're holding
has been bewitched ♫

324
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,780
♫ No one will come looking for you
to take you back ♫

325
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,420
♫ Birds in the trees chirp incessantly ♫

326
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,250
What is your understanding of the world?

327
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,230
The world

328
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,470
is just one of the mathematical forms

329
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,610
among an infinite number of possibilities.

330
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,270
So,

331
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,630
what's your future plan?

332
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,000
Together with you,

333
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,410
I want to get Fields Medal

334
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,110
before I turn 35.

335
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,200
What is your life's insight?

336
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,260
♫ Oh, confused people trying
to find a way out of the mist ♫

337
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,440
♫ Feeling afraid in the empty night ♫

338
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,490
I love you.

339
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,260
Me too.

340
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,460
♫ No one is willing to stay and chat ♫

341
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,670
♫ Struggling in the whirlpool
of poverty with all your might ♫

342
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,970
Are you still angry?

343
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,840
If you're not going
to talk about the case,

344
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,260
I'm leaving.

345
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,080
Sit down.

346
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,340
This is the settlement
put forward by my principle.

347
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,220
[Settlement Agreement]

348
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,570
I think it's reasonable.

349
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,760
Give it a thought.

350
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,510
Wait.

351
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,720
For what?

352
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,440
Excuse me.

353
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,430
Miss Yun.

354
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,510
We met in a hurry last time.

355
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,580
And we didn't have time
to make a self-introduction

356
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,730
I'm Chen Rui.

357
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,240
In the future,

358
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,330
I'll be in charge

359
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,090
of the settlement

360
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,550
between Mr Lu and Mr Han.

361
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,330
Alright.

362
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,750
You two know each other now.

363
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,900
Keep communicating.

364
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,680
-Will do.
-I'm off.

365
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,710
Miss Yun.

366
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,400
Miss Yun.

367
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,700
Let's get started.

368
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,710
Okay.

369
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,080
Here you are.

370
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,110
Thank you.

371
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,700
The details of the settlement

372
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,120
[Settlement Agreement]

373
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,980
is almost finalized.

374
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,950
Have a look.

375
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,560
I don't accept settlement.

376
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,800
You have not yet seen
the specific terms we've negotiated.

377
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,770
Don't bother.

378
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,670
I will not settle.

379
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,970
You're an entertainer,

380
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,770
a star.

381
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,810
Have you considered
the consequences of going to trial?

382
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,830
I don't care.

383
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,920
Listen, Lu Yu. You need to face the music.

384
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,760
The incident of you beating someone
has gone viral.

385
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,320
Now, online media is advanced.

386
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,430
People will talk from nothing.

387
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,200
Plus, you're in the wrong.

388
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,800
If it goes to the court,

389
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,750
it will become irrefutable proof.

390
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,890
Then your career

391
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,990
will be ruined

392
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,140
I'm tired being a celebrity anyway.

393
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:09,910
I can have some rest.

394
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,950
You're tired?

395
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,960
Do you know how tired
others are because of you?

396
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,340
Lawyer Yun worked
hard for your settlement.

397
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,330
You know what?

398
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,950
Lawyer Yun

399
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:24,540
insisted on adding
a non-disclosure agreement.

400
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,450
When you sign the agreement,

401
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,910
the two parties are not allowed to

402
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,590
disclose the details to anyone.

403
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,970
Or huge compensation will be paid by
the party which discloses such details.

404
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,150
What did you say just now?

405
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,150
I said that Lawyer Yun worked really hard.

406
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,950
She convinced Han Rong to sign

407
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,310
the settlement using
her professional ability.

408
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,550
Also, she restricted Han Rong

409
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,910
through the subtle use of legal means.

410
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,620
Lawyer Yun really cares about you.

411
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,030
She knows what means a lot to you.

412
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,000
So she spared no efforts

413
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,080
to protect you.

414
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,360
[Sorry, the number you've dialled
cannot be connected.]

415
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,160
[Please try again later.]

416
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,490
Where is Yun Lan?

417
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,310
She is on leave.

418
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,730
Come here.

419
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,490
Come on, let's take a group photo.

420
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,330
Come. Take a group photo.

421
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,300
Come on!

422
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,590
Line up!

423
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,750
Come here, Yu'er.

424
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,000
Look this way.

425
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,250
Hurry up.

426
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,000
We graduated!

427
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,090
Yun Shu!

428
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,440
Yi Yi.

429
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,790
You're here.

430
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,960
Yun Shu, though your
graduation is one year late,

431
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,680
you still graduated.

432
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,730
Today is a lucky day,

433
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,980
so stop mocking me.

434
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,860
I'm extending my congratulations.

435
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,060
Yun Shu.

436
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,130
Lin Nuo.

437
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,960
Congratulations!

438
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,140
I thought you would never graduate.

439
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,800
You two are really made for each other.

440
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,290
Let's take a group photo.

441
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,260
Okay.

442
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,870
How about I take pictures of you two?

443
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,310
Okay. Come on, Yi Yi.

444
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,700
One. Two. Three.

445
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,480
One more.

446
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:42,920
Three, two, one.

447
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,270
Smile.

448
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,240
Yun Shu.

449
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,720
Happy graduation.

450
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,020
Mr Zhang.

451
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,030
I'll take photos of you.

452
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,410
I'll do it for you, Mr Zhang.

453
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,020
Here we go.

454
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,750
-Three...
-Hold on!

455
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,300
You two go ahead.

456
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,350
Three, two, one.

457
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,660
Smile.

458
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,290
One more.

459
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,670
Mr Zhang.

460
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,120
Mr Zhang, I want to take
a picture with you.

461
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,020
Come on, hurry.

462
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,790
Here you are.

463
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,020
Look this way, Mr Zhang.

464
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,620
Done!

465
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,390
This way.

466
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,030
Help us take one.

467
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,000
Is this okay?

468
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,210
Give me a few minutes.

469
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,950
-Look here.
-I'll take it.

470
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,880
-This way.
-Look here.

471
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,090
Your husband is really charming.

472
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,880
It's my turn. Come on.

473
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,480
Look at the camera.

474
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,700
Come on, look here.

475
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,940
Come on, look at the camera, Mr Zhang.

476
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,440
So,

477
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,100
will Zhang Si Nian go with you?

478
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,830
No.

479
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,440
He will stay here with grandpa.

480
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,420
Besides,

481
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,930
I'm only going there to settle
the admission this time.

482
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,680
Actual work will begin next month.

483
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,060
You've really matured.

484
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,730
You can think of the big picture now.

485
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,450
I wanted to persuade you before.

486
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,080
But you figured it out yourself.

487
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,720
Sis, I've been married for one year.

488
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,300
I'm a grown-up.

489
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,010
You just keep

490
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,670
showing off in front of me.

491
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,860
I am not.

492
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,500
I can't send

493
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,050
you off that day.

494
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,510
I have a trip.

495
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,530
It's alright.

496
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,010
Si Nian will send me off.

497
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,230
You just concentrate on your work.

498
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,770
Work matters.

499
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,110
It's not for work.

500
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,320
I just want to go away to have a rest.

501
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,350
How about Lu Yu?

502
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,490
He doesn't know it.

503
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,350
You

504
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,000
had a fight again?

505
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,160
Leave us alone.

506
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,290
Just mind your own business.

507
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,350
Sis, Lu Yu is actually...

508
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,790
Let's go.

509
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,890
Let's go to the mall.

510
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,860
Mall?

511
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,190
I'll buy you something

512
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,860
and buy grandpa some supplement.

513
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,470
-Okay.
-Let's go.

514
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,810
Academician Zhang,

515
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,080
I've consulted many
doctors about this treatment.

516
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,260
It has a high success rate.

517
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,780
And it's highly feasible.

518
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,990
Save it.

519
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,240
I won't go.

520
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,010
How long will it work?

521
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,060
One year?

522
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,240
Two years?

523
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,300
I'm old now.

524
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,610
I have to leave the world

525
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,500
when my time comes.

526
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,580
I don't want to lie on
an unfamiliar bed overseas

527
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:38,110
and wait for my life to end.

528
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,870
Just let me go as I wish.

529
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:44,980
Let me maintain my dignity.

530
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,750
You need to follow my
advice this time, Grandpa.

531
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,750
Where's Yun Shu?

532
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,740
Yun Shu is with her sister.

533
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,200
She wanted to say goodbye to her.

534
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,470
Goodbye?

535
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,510
Yun Shu is going to go abroad.

536
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,330
The cartoonist she admires

537
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,180
gave her an offer.

538
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,170
That's good news.

539
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,250
But Yun Shu

540
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,300
is hoping that I can take you

541
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,720
abroad to get treatment.

542
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,580
That's why she chose
to go to Kobayashi Studio.

543
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,590
She didn't want to go

544
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,330
because you're in poor health.

545
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,990
So you should go abroad with me

546
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,340
for the treatment.

547
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,540
If she knows that you won't go abroad,

548
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,650
she won't go

549
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,460
to Kobayashi Studio.

550
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,150
No.

551
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,000
We can't hamper Yun Shu's career.

552
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,270
Don't let her know.

553
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,740
I won't lie to her

554
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,250
regarding this matter.

555
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,020
A white lie is not a lie.

556
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,800
I can't be the stumbling block

557
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,390
getting in the way of you youngsters.

558
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,550
Grandpa.

559
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,200
Yun Shu.

560
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:56,760
Yun Shu is here.

561
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,380
How are you feeling today?

562
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,470
Do you feel better?

563
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,860
Yes.

564
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,510
I'm just craving for something delicious.

565
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,720
I knew it.

566
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,900
That's why I brought
a lot of delicious food for you.

567
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,110
Great!

568
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,740
I brought you
your favourite dried pork slices.

569
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,230
Which flavour do you prefer?

570
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,670
-This one.
-Okay.

571
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,790
I'll open it for you.

572
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,020
Yun Shu.

573
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,810
Yun Shu is so sweet.

574
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,320
Lin Nuo.

575
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,580
Lin Nuo.

576
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,100
Lin Nuo.

577
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,730
Come on.

578
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,070
You're avoiding me as if I were a virus.

579
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,530
Are you really so sick of me?

580
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,410
Go home.

581
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,070
Please leave me alone.

582
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,310
Gu Xiao and I aren't together.

583
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,510
Have a look.

584
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,010
I deleted his WeChat.

585
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:03,980
Yi Yi.

586
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,280
It's over between us.

587
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,680
But we can start over.

588
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,500
We can start from being friends.

589
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,900
Lin Nuo, I've changed.

590
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,310
If you still can't believe me,

591
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,750
we can go to get a marriage certificate.

592
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,310
I brought my household register.

593
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,160
Lin Nuo,

594
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,430
I know I treated you badly.

595
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,490
I know you've liked me since before.

596
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,750
I thought you would never leave me.

597
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,630
So I took advantage
of your affection towards me.

598
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,700
I understand why you're sick of me now.

599
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,670
But,

600
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,220
I need to tell you

601
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,010
or I'll regret it.

602
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,000
Yi Yi.

603
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,380
It's too late.

604
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,350
I'm leaving for Africa next month.

605
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,030
Next month?

606
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,230
Yes.

607
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,750
You're going there for a trip?

608
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,490
-I can...
-No.

609
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,840
I'm going there to work.

610
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,380
Medical support.

611
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,460
For how long?

612
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,020
It doesn't matter.

613
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,310
I will go

614
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,570
with Xia Lin.

615
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,320
Yi Yi.

616
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,190
I'm not sick of you

617
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,130
because I've let go of

618
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,390
my feelings for you.

619
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,330
You'll find the one

620
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,060
who loves you

621
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,180
sooner or later.

622
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,900
I think

623
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,070
you won't remember me at that time.

624
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,680
Mr Zhang.

625
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,330
What's going on?

626
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,670
Stop here.

627
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,020
I'm afraid that I won't

628
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,660
go through security

629
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,740
and board the plane

630
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,450
because you're there.

631
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,750
Just stop here.

632
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,110
Okay.

633
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,540
Check whether everything is ready.

634
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,300
Remember the passport.

635
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:45,520
It's alright.

636
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,830
I have everything.

637
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:01,970
♫ Turning off the lights
in search of its trace ♫

638
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,560
Alright.

639
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,560
Go or you will miss the plane.

640
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:08,050
♫ I walk steadily
on the path beneath my feet ♫

641
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,690
I'll be back to send you and grandpa off

642
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:14,380
♫ I hear someone asking,
are you still here? ♫

643
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,860
in a week.

644
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,730
That's a deal.

645
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,420
Go now or you'll be late.

646
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,230
♫ The kind person replies,
I've always been here ♫

647
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,300
♫ This love cuts through the crowd
in search of me ♫

648
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,380
♫ It isn't easy ♫

649
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:30,140
♫ I only wish to cherish it with you ♫

650
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,540
♫ Each and every moment ♫

651
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:38,310
♫ If I missed out, I will meet you again
in another lifetime ♫

652
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:44,980
♫ I recognise your eyes,
a secret that belongs to me ♫

653
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,040
Lin Nuo, I won't fall in love with others.

654
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,170
I will only wait for you.

655
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,160
Yi Yi.

656
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,680
Let it go.

657
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,020
We have to move on.

658
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,710
Lin Nuo.

659
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,990
I know I was wrong.

660
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,860
I know I treated you badly.

661
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,000
I don't know why I was so mean to you.

662
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,830
I feel really regretful now.

663
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,780
Can you give me one more chance?

664
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,830
What do you think?

665
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,480
Someone who loved me so much before

666
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,630
can't possibly feel nothing now.

667
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,390
I didn't believe the words

668
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,470
that said

669
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,930
we can meet the right one at right time.

670
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,100
I believed love should come naturally.

671
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,650
It's not about the right and wrong.

672
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,940
But after we experienced so much,

673
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,630
I began to believe that

674
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,840
what they said is true.

675
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,320
If the timing is wrong,

676
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,510
even if we're in love,

677
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,800
we'll miss each other.

678
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,730
So I missed out on you.

679
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,080
No.

680
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,050
We can still be friends.

681
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,890
Best friends forever.

682
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,689
Take care.
