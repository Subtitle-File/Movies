[Episode 24]

4
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:18,190
Mr Zhang.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,700
What's going on?

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,460
Stop here.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,440
I'm afraid that I won't

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,030
go through security

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,030
and go on board later

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,310
because of you.

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,640
Just stop here.

12
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,660
OK,

13
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,830
Check whether everything is ready.

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,790
Remember the passport.

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,950
It's alright.

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,360
They're all in it.

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,970
Alright.

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,490
Go or you will miss the plane.

19
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,950
I'll be back to

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,200
send you and grandpa off

21
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,690
a week later.

22
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,340
Deal.

23
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,490
Go.

24
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,170
Or you'll be late.

25
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,350
Excuse me, after you.

26
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,440
Thank you.

27
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,590
Yun Shu, I'm really sorry

28
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,170
because I can't go with you.

29
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,570
I hope what I prepared

30
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,640
can help you.

31
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,820
[Follow the instructions on
the note papers step by step.]

32
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,929
Follow the steps on the note.

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,689
One by one.

34
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,770
First,

35
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,640
go and get a local bank card

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,990
and a bus card.

37
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,320
I've written

38
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,520
down the specific address.

39
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,230
To get to the studio, take the subway

40
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,390
to the Hanzomon Jimbocho station.

41
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,150
You can get there

42
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,360
straight from Exit No. 8.

43
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,660
With my friend's help,

44
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,610
I rented an apartment for you

45
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,490
very close to your comic studio.

46
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:56,860
It's a five-minute

47
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,570
walk away.

48
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,910
In the vicinity of your apartment,

49
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,230
there are 144 restaurants

50
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,759
within five km.

51
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,340
There is a Chinese Restaurant

52
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,940
200 meters away from your apartment.

53
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,790
The food there is authentic.

54
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,620
In the vicinity of your apartment,

55
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,040
There are also 5 convenience stores.

56
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,410
You can pay by mobile phone.

57
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,070
By the way,

58
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,710
be safe

59
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,810
because you live alone.

60
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,510
Put a pair of male shoes on the porch.

61
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,160
Hang up some of my clothes

62
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,470
on the balcony.

63
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,760
I put one coat of

64
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:34,730
mine into

65
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,360
your suitcase.

66
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,640
Yun Shu, why...

67
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,440
You're really eager to let me go abroad.

68
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,920
So,

69
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,210
How could you know I'm here?

70
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,910
In the past,

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,160
when I was in a bad mood,

72
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,540
I would go to the cinema alone

73
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,170
to watch a comedy.

74
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,960
It's the best way for me

75
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,570
to get relieved.

76
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,790
You're taking revenge on me?

77
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,500
You know I don't want you

78
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,460
to lose the chance.

79
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,560
I know.

80
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,950
I didn't go.

81
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,240
This may seem childish

82
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,640
and impulsive,

83
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,790
but it's definitely not
a random decision.

84
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,770
I know it means a lot to me.

85
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,640
But I believe I'll have

86
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,340
the same chance again.

87
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,009
You gave up what you like

88
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,870
and what you're good at.

89
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,640
Mr Zhang.

90
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,020
You and grandpa are my family.

91
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,910
You're irreplaceable for me.

92
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:14,760
And

93
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,960
I didn't say I would give up
making comics.

94
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,140
I will keep doing it.

95
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,970
But I want to keep doing it

96
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,070
with the one I love.

97
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,770
Thanks, Yun Shu.

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,240
You can always throw light on me

99
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,270
at critical times.

100
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,090
Let's move back to grandpa's house.

101
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:50,649
OK.

102
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,200
By the way,

103
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,020
I dropped my

104
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,160
suitcase at the airport.

105
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,840
We can get it back

106
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,440
after the movie.

107
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,610
Mei, I'm really sorry.

108
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,780
I was too capricious.

109
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,260
I'm willing to draw pictures for the
company without pay

110
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,570
for three years to repay your kindness.

111
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,230
Alright.

112
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,410
Just kidding.

113
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,600
I thought you're really mad.

114
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,040
I'm not mad at you.

115
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,150
I can understand your choice.

116
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,550
When I was young,

117
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,370
I put love above everything.

118
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,960
So, Mei,

119
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,710
do you still believe in love?

120
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,960
If I didn't believe in love,

121
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,960
I wouldn't publish Perfect

122
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,620
and Casual.

123
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:22,810
I

124
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,960
still believe in love

125
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,440
Mei.

126
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,070
You're so handsome.

127
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,960
Come on, save it.

128
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,090
Give me a break.

129
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,950
I'll give you one week off

130
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,810
to spend time with your grandpa-in-law.

131
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,460
So,

132
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,200
about Mr Kobayashi's studio...

133
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,200
Don't worry.

134
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,640
I'll take care of it for you.

135
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,510
Go.

136
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,060
Get out of my eyes.

137
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,610
Go.

138
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,130
Yun Lan.

139
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,360
Well,

140
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,210
I've signed the settlement.

141
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,760
I know.

142
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,400
Can I have a talk with you alone?

143
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,560
Lan, I'm leaving now.

144
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:29,850
Sorry.

145
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,860
I realised

146
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,880
although you're Han Rong's lawyer,

147
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,150
you've been protecting

148
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,800
and defending me.

149
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm an idiot.

150
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,880
And I know nothing at all.

151
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:40,990
It's okay.

152
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,500
I knew this would happen

153
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,590
before I did that.

154
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,910
You couldn't understand my intention

155
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,410
with your IQ.

156
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,430
I know,

157
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,750
I was so mad before because

158
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,570
I starred in so many dramas.

159
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,200
There is no such dramatic

160
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,180
plot in those TV series.

161
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,800
I couldn't accept that.

162
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,390
So can you accept it now?

163
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,960
Yes.

164
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:02,930
Yun Lan.

165
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,610
Thank you.

166
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,980
Don't bother.

167
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,910
Go back and fulfil your
settlement agreement.

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,210
This is the best outcome

169
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,290
I could get for you.

170
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,550
I only said I wanted to break up

171
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,960
because I was mad.

172
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,040
Don't take it seriously.

173
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,280
We're still in a relationship.

174
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,290
The die

175
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,310
is cast.

176
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,660
After you said you wanted to break up,

177
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,240
I considered our problems carefully.

178
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,360
Maybe we're not for each other.

179
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,700
Breaking up

180
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,090
is the best choice for us.

181
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,080
I know, I'm an idiot.

182
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:39,560
I'm

183
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,200
childish

184
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,560
and I'm impulsive.

185
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,910
I've never felt so ashamed

186
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,240
in my whole life.

187
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,250
Yun Lan,

188
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,610
please forgive me.

189
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,580
Lu Yu,

190
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,640
I admit that we had a happy time before.

191
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,630
But we're so different

192
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,130
from our way

193
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,990
of thinking

194
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,370
and minds.

195
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,160
If we continue this relationship,

196
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,910
we'll break up sooner or later.

197
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,910
No.

198
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,560
No.

199
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,740
Love can change everything.

200
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,770
Lu Yu.

201
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,260
I'm really tired.

202
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,960
Lan,

203
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,620
It's almost 2 o'clock.
I'll have a meeting.

204
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:43,960
Lan,

205
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,270
You've been staying up late recently?

206
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,740
Yesterday,

207
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,090
you fell asleep all of sudden.

208
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,800
Maybe I'm so tired

209
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:52,770
from lack of rest.

210
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,940
Apply for annual leave for me afterwards.

211
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,200
Lan,

212
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,960
you need to have a good rest.

213
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,160
Then I'll go out first.

214
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,270
OK

215
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,990
Grandpa is going to be
discharged from hospital.

216
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,000
But I'll go

217
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,290
for Lu Yu.

218
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,670
OK

219
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,240
Xia Lin?

220
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,970
Mrs Zhang,

221
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,360
Professor Zhang,

222
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,750
I heard that Academician Zhang
is getting discharged.

223
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,610
Yes.

224
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,360
We're here for the discharge procedure.

225
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,640
Didn't you go to Africa?

226
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,720
Africa?

227
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,560
No.

228
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,160
But Lin Nuo said he

229
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,240
went to Africa with you.

230
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,950
Only one in our office

231
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,160
went to Africa.

232
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,060
I have to go.

233
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,560
What's going on, Yun Shu?

234
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,830
What's wrong?

235
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,680
I have to call Yi Yi.

236
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,350
Hello.

237
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,580
Hello, Yi Yi.

238
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,750
I saw Xia Lin when I went to the hospital

239
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,190
with Mr Zhang today.

240
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,320
She said she wouldn't go to Africa.

241
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,560
Only Lin Nuo went there.

242
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,010
So,

243
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,690
He lied to me.

244
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,550
Oh, Yi Yi.

245
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,490
Don't assume the worst.

246
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,500
I think

247
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,810
Lin Nuo...

248
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,440
He may...

249
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,370
He never told lies before.

250
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,470
This time, in order to avoid me

251
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,340
he tried so hard.

252
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,830
Oh, Yi Yi.

253
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,970
I'm OK.

254
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,640
You don't have to console me.

255
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,070
Bye.

256
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,450
Lan, Lan.

257
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,910
Hello

258
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,360
I'll come in.

259
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,560
Lan, I'm here.

260
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,210
What's wrong? Why are you so anxious?

261
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,340
Order something first.

262
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,970
Orange Juice, Please.

263
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,760
What's going on?

264
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,660
I'm pregnant.

265
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,620
You're pregnant?

266
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,209
Lu Yu is the father?

267
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,730
Lan, congratulations

268
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,360
I'll be the auntie.

269
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:28,699
When will you marry Lu Yu?

270
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,090
I don't plan to get married.

271
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,360
So,

272
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:34,880
Well, did Lu Yu know that?

273
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,419
No, I didn't tell him.

274
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,010
Thank you.

275
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,810
Don't drink coffee, you're pregnant now.

276
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,140
Drink this.

277
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,430
Lan.

278
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,390
What will you do then?

279
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,760
I have no idea.

280
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,810
None of this is part of my plan.

281
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,880
I'll become a partner next year.

282
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,290
I'm busy with two big cases now.

283
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,740
Yun Shu,

284
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,680
I made an appointment with the doctor.

285
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,290
Accompany me to the hospital next month.

286
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,280
Lan.

287
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,570
Don't try to persuade me.

288
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,590
Lan,

289
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,690
since childhood,

290
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,680
I've always stood by your decision.

291
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,080
But I think you should

292
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,490
have told Lu Yu.

293
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,760
No one answers the door.

294
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,220
Nian Nian.

295
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,260
I lost my girlfriend.

296
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,040
Don't move.

297
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,750
I'm miserable now.

298
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,290
I'm heart-broken.

299
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,290
I need your warm consolation.

300
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,660
Yun Shu is here.

301
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,860
Hello.

302
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,340
Pregnant?

303
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,280
My sis knew that just now.

304
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,250
But she said she didn't want to

305
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,100
tell you that.

306
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,440
But I think you should.

307
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,500
But I think it's about you two.

308
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,480
So.

309
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,890
So you have the right to know.

310
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,290
Just extend your thanks by words.

311
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,310
Thank you, sis-in-law.

312
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,480
You're my saviour.

313
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,150
I've never seen my sis

314
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,340
act this way since my childhood.

315
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,620
So.

316
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,340
So where is he now?

317
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,430
He must go to change his clothes

318
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,040
then he'll rush to your sis.

319
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,300
From now on, we're a family.

320
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,510
I'm going to find Yun Lan.

321
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,500
Nian Nian.

322
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,110
Take good care of my sis-in-law.

323
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,820
Or I'll get you punished.

324
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,940
Silly boy!

325
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,690
So.

326
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,330
I'm the younger sis-in-law or

327
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,690
elder sis-in-law?

328
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,090
You're the elder sis-in-law of course.

329
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,870
Great.

330
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:54,710
Lan,

331
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,910
Come to the doorway.

332
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,010
Lu Yu is waiting for you.

333
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,340
All the people are watching.

334
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,880
What's the matter?

335
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,560
Can you think it over
before you do something?

336
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,940
It's Lu Yun. The real Lu Yu.

337
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,640
Yun Shu told me everything.

338
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,080
I don't know what you're talking about.

339
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,310
He's so handsome.

340
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,620
It's him.

341
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,160
Marry me.

342
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,160
Come on, give me a break.

343
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,630
I love you. I want to marry you.

344
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,440
You think I'm making a scene?

345
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,510
Let's go somewhere else.

346
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,780
Yun Lan, I love you.

347
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,590
I imagined our future life,
living together

348
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,180
many times.

349
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,630
I just have no guts
to tell you my feelings.

350
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,030
I was afraid that you would reject me.

351
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,140
I was afraid that you'd run away

352
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,570
if I proposed to you.

353
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,440
When I knew you were pregnant,

354
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,680
I just want to marry you.

355
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,500
It's the only idea in my mind

356
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,160
I want to marry you.

357
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,480
Even if it means getting rejected
by you

358
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,840
or scaring you away,

359
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,430
I will keep proposing

360
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,910
till you say yes.

361
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,200
Stand up first.

362
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,220
Say Yes first.

363
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,080
What's wrong with you?

364
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:38,560
I...

365
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,950
I feel unwell.

366
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,630
Oh, no.

367
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,910
What?

368
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,290
My tummy hurts.

369
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,420
Tummy hurts?

370
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:46,760
Are you OK?

371
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,140
I will take you to the hospital.

372
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,840
Slow down.

373
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,480
They are well matched.

374
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,510
Yes.

375
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,770
So sweet.

376
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,640
Are you feeling unwell?

377
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,990
I'm OK.

378
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,110
I was only fooling you.

379
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,040
Come on.

380
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,370
How could you kid this thing?

381
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,040
You made me angry.

382
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,240
Everybody's watching.

383
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,690
I feel so embarrassed.

384
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,510
Come on.

385

573
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,340
Don't go to school.

574
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,310
Don't let more people

575
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,560
know about our relationship.

576
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,310
Do you look down on me?

577
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,950
You think I'm

578
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,440
a useless person?

579
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,800
Who are you?

580
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,760
I'm Zhang Si Nian.

581
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,880
I'm her husband.

582
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:23,860
We're married.

583
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,240
From today on,

584
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,890
Yun Shu,

585
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,360
you're my wife.

586
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,330
First,

587
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,140
our education background
has nothing to do

588
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:35,900
♫ The night will pass,
I am the dawn ♫

589
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,610
with our relationship.

590
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,580
I can vouch for it with my character.

591
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:35,880
I won't force Yun Shu

592
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,740
to do anything she doesn't want to do.

593
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,980
♫ Protecting this innocence,
evident in your eyes ♫

594
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,300
I'll respect her,

595
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,300
love her

596
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,280
and protect her.

597
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,070
In the next one year,

598
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:48,580
♫ I hear someone asking,
do dreams come to an end? ♫

599
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,640
I'll help her

600
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:45,800
and tutor her

601
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,820
to make sure that she can
successfully finish her final defence.

602
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,590
And I also ensure that

603
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:54,380
♫ I will keep you company in
the future, never letting go ♫

604
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,910
nobody will call her a fool.

605
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,630
I carefully selected this

606
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,970
elementary exercise for you.

607
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:58,080
♫ This love cuts through the crowd
in search of me ♫

608
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,370
You have to finish them in one hour.

609
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,120
♫ It doesn't make sense ♫

610
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,930
♫ All I can do is silently
feel your breath ♫

611
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,080
We got married first
and then fell in love.

612
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,260
♫ And take you in my arms ♫

613
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,040
I'm a

614
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,760
prim man with no interests.

615
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:11,980
♫ If you care whether we'll still
be together in the next life ♫

616
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,170
Let's go.

617
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:18,560
♫ I want you to believe in my conviction ♫

618
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,370
I'm willing to wait for you
halfway up the hill.

619
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,060
♫ This love cuts through the crowd
in search of me ♫

620
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,210
I'll hold her hands.

621
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,200
♫ It isn't easy ♫

622
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,160
♫ I only wish to cherish it with you ♫

623
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,200
♫ Each and every moment ♫

624
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,400
♫ If I missed out, I will meet you again
in another lifetime ♫

625
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,840
♫ I recognise your eyes,
a secret that belongs to me ♫

626
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,360
Mr Zhang,

627
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,560
can I ask you a question?

628
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:53,550
OK.

629
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,760
Do you think you have a perfect life?

630
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,080
Without you, my casual lady,

631
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:01,710
my life can't be perfect.
